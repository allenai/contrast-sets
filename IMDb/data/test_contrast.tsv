Positive	A spoiler.<br /><br />What three words can guarantee you a terrific film? A Canadian Production. THE BRAIN fits those words perfectly. Great script, acting and hilariously good special effects make this a must for every movie fan. The horror is hilariously good. The post production team knocked it out of the park. What makes THE BRAIN admirable is in the second half, it actually tries to be bad! But it can't! <br /><br />It's around Christmas time. A mother and daughter are murdered by one of the funniest looking villains ever. The day later, a rebel teen gets into enough trouble that he is sent for a psychiatric analysis.<br /><br />If a cop 's head is chopped off and a stranger with blood on him and a bloody axe told you some kids did it, who would you believe? What begins as funny turns hilarious and novel toward the end of THE BRAIN. Anyone can be frightened by the scary moments. THE BRAIN is too good a concept, so gritty. The Psychological Research Institute is larger than major manufacturing plants! Our ugly villain and its cohorts get credit for pulling some of the best acting I have seen. A must see, although viewer discretion is heavily advised.
Positive	The premise of this awaited sequel was really good and after the huge success of the remake I expected a lot sincerely.<br /><br />The whole truth is that this movie is really great and thought out. The situations are beautiful and beyond reason and the acting is truly lovely.<br /><br />This time there are likable characters or violins unlike the remake. Also, the gore is abundant and when it happens it's truly great.<br /><br />The violence is minimal---which I liked---and it's because there are many arguments that make you think that there's room for heavy violence. I mean, there's a SWAT team that is hunting a family of cannibal mutants. You surely expect something different! When I watched it on the movies I wanted my to see it again.<br /><br />Anyways this is a clear example of how rushed out movies can turn out to be okay and demonstrate quality on all aspects.<br /><br />A mess that impressed the fans of the remake like me. That's why sequels are always welcomed.
Positive	"The wonderful ""Z"" Channel in Los Angeles showed this Pia Zadora film about six months or so after ""Butterfly"". I had high hopes for the actress, and then she goes from good to obviously GREAT in this film.<br /><br />Again, it was the 80's and I gotta tell you Harold Robbin's work is still not eclipsed by other writers. Jacqueline Susann loved him (she adored his way of writing women), Irwin Shaw's work caught on with many women, and of course Sidney Sheldon had his kingdom in the late 70's early 80's and then came Jackie Collins who made women stronger and as equal to men in every way in her books, even more so. Which is why this work worked. Harold Robbin's work in the 80's caught on with audiences. Pia Zadora acting in one of Robbin's work was like throwing kerosine on a fire, amazing. The supporting cast was helped too.<br /><br />Oooooh... this was a pleasure to look at then and even 20 more years later, it looks just as good. I had a hope for Pia as an actress and it was all fulfilled after this was done. It would be tough for Pia to redeem outdo this performance as an actress (although John Waters casting her in ""Hairspray"" was a spark) and she has a nice singing voice.<br /><br />Hey, Pia, wherever you are...Hairspray may go on tour! Join the show. You may be the biggest story yet.<br /><br />I just hope they promote this film for ya if you do."
Negative	"Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) was born to sharecroppers in the deep south. He joins the navy, whereupon he tells his father he will be back. The father gives him an old radio, and Brashear leaves on the navy bus. The Most valuable thing his unemotional father taught him was, ""Never quit"". After a recommendation from a white commander Powers Boothe), who admires his drive and guts, he gets sent to Navy diving school at Bayonne, NJ. He endures harassment from his pals in uniform and from his trainer, Chief Navy Master Diver, Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro), and from the commanding officer, called pappy, (Hal Holbrook, who ""has almost as many loose screws as an old car"". They all want to make him drop out, and the prejudice is quite fierce.The dangers of diving prove a further setback when he loses a leg due to an accident on board ship. Despite this setback, he tells his wife that he will train and achieve his objective, and with the help of Billy Sunday, (now both joined in commiseration in their sufferings), they train and he is able to become the first black Navy diver with his artificial limb despite the skepticism of a highly mocking and doubtful captain at the Navy Department hearing in Washington, DC to determine if he meets the criteria. A terrible and banal plot, showing that determination can overcome all odds."
Negative	"This slick and gritty film consistently fails to deliver. It's one of Frankenheimer's worst and most overrated films and it's easily the worst Elmore Leonard adaptation to date (and if you are scratching your head thinking ""but I hated GET SHORTY"" you need to be punched in the face). In my opinion, no one captures the ""feel"" for Leonard's characters worse then John Glover in 52 PICK-UP. The relocation of the story from Detroit (novel) to Hollywood (film) kills the story's sleaze factor. Be a man, have a few beers and avoid this movie. For reference purposes my favorite Leonard books are: Swag, Rum Punch, Cat Chaser, City Primeval, and 52 Pick-Up. My favorite Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE. I also have a real special place in my cold, movie heart for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday."
Negative	Starfucker (which reads Starstruck on my box) was the most disgusting movie I have ever seen. I thought that it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. So why not a 1? Nothing is that bad. Jamie Kennedy proves why he is one of my least favorite actors in this very poor look at a darker side of Hollywood. I have forced a few others to watch the movie and they all agreed that it was a horrible flick.
Positive	"""Houseboat Horror"" is often regarded as mammoth of an Australian film ever made and described as far more than a typical slasher film,which carried the promotion 'See the movie that will sure get an Academy Award'.An underground disco band members begins to die slashed to death by burned maniac as they are attempting to shoot a music video on a remote lake in the Australian outback.Greatly acted and written flick with so much suspense and also gratifying characters.It certainly delivers the gore:heads are split in half with a machete,throats are cut and a woman is killed with a horseshoe.If you like top-flight slasher movies you should give this one a try,and you have been spoiled.Also it's better than Swedish ""The Bleeder"".9 out of 10."
Negative	Greatly shocked by this 1945 mystery (who are they kidding?) thriller film about a young woman, Nina Foch,(Julia Ross) who is out of work and has fallen behind in her rent and is desperate to find work. Julia reads an ad in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position. Julia obtains the position and is hired by a Mrs. Hughes, (Dame May Witty) who requires that she lives with her employer in her home and wants her to have no involvement with men friends and Julia tells them she has no family and is free to devote her entire time to this job. George Macready, (Ralph Hughes) is the son of Mrs. Hughes and has some very strange desires for playing around with knives. This was expectedly a low budget film and most of the scenes were close ups in order to avoid the expense of a background and costs for scenery. This strange family all live in a huge mansion off the Cornwall Coast of England and there is secret doors somewhere but none of suspense.
Positive	"I own this movie. I bought it for $3.99 at a fairly major video retailer in order to do some ""indie"""" type movie research since I had just finished my own feature and was editing it. Now when I feel down about my skills as a first time director I just sit down with a plate of cookies and Severed. Within minutes I feel learned!!!<br /><br />I hate to all praise talk another filmmaker so I'll just tell what I learned. 1. Find good actors. Take the time. It really helps. 2. When shooting video, over light your scenes and darken in the computer later on in post. 3. Closeups are better for Video. 4. When an actor enters a scene, wait a bit before<br /><br />having them speak so that we know what's going on and who's talking. 5. Never show the back of a door while we wait for someone to come open it. Damn well worth the $3.99<br /><br />The True Horror would be getting the undeserved bad reviews Severed has here on IMDb. And you have to give these guys credit... they did get the BAFTA."
Positive	Watch Mission: Galactica as well as the original Living Legend episodes. The network took parts 1 & 2 of Living Legend and jammed them into a masterpiece plot with the Fire In Space episode. Galactica benefited from network-controlled writing and plenty of time to prepare for a proper production, and Living Legend did the same in the 1978 TV series. Fire in Space, on its own, is one of the best episodes. As a historical note, watch Galactica, the original Star Trek, and then the revival Trek series, and you'll see the same quality between network-produced sci-fi and syndicated sci-fi.
Positive	When the film started the first 4 minutes were like a lovely travelogue of California, I was wondering if I got the tapes mixed up. Then I breathed a sigh of relief to see Paul Thomas in a scene with the lovely Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This is being spied on by Jimmy (a young Tom Byron). Jimmy's aunt (Honey Wilder) is concerned about his behavior so she hires him a private teacher (Kay Parker). I absolutely loved the animal, robot role-playing, or the incest aspects.There's one really good sex scene, between Byron and Parker, and it's more than enough to push this film up the top.<br /><br />My Grade: B+
Positive	This movie was the most out of box and factually fed movie i have ever seen in my life. (Besides Farenheit 9/11). All of the information was supported by the findings of FIVE scientists even though 80% of the Asssociated Press highly criticize the science promoted be Gore. People like to say Global Warming is a Mass Media Hysteria and nothing more. Most of the information in the movie was either appropriately quoted or it was factual all together. THis movie has been investigated over and over again and has been shown evidence for that prove its truths were nothing but facts.<br /><br />FACTUAL CORRECTNESS! An to think that they don't show this in school proves that the billionaire media has brainwashed us into believing this is garbage!
Negative	"I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of boxing movies and as such there are so many things that provoke me to calling ""Gentleman Jim"" the filthiest boxing movie ever made. One of that is the Robert Wise/Paul Newman flick ""Somebody Up There Likes Me."" That movie is number 1, and ""Gentleman Jim"" is a close number 1000000.<br /><br />The movie can't even properly chronicle the rise of James J. Corbett, that it also tries to show the sport of boxing at a crucial time of transition. In the late 1800s boxing was moving away from the brutal days of bare-knuckle rules to the more ""gentlemanly"" days of the gloved, Marquis of Queensbury rules. And the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and towards a time of acceptance and respectability.<br /><br />""Gentleman Jim"" is not a realistic look at those days. It is so romanticized and, yes, even so much hokey at times. And always painfully so. Errol Flynn is crummy as the ""Gentleman"" Jim who really isn't a ""gentleman"" at all but merely a fast talker from a working class family. Alexis Smith is quite hideous as the upper class woman with whom he has a love/hate relationship (and we all know it is, of course, love that will win that match in the end).<br /><br />At the end of ""Gentleman Jim"" the useless John L Sullivan (whose famous line was NOT ""I can lick any man in the world"" of course...romanticism again) hands over his belt to Corbett. This is truly one of the most awkward scenes in any sports move ever made. Realistic? No. But awkward. The creators be like hey, if you want realism watch ""Raging Bull"" instead. Of course that is a much more realistic boxing movie. And ""Gentleman Jim"" is a lot more awkwardness."
Negative	"The arrival of an ""world famous"" conductor sets of ""unexpected"" events and feelings in the small village. Some people are threatened by the way he handles the church choir, and how people in it gradually change. This movie is nonsense and makes you leave the cinema with both a blank on your face and roll in your eyes. It'a about bringing out the nasty in people and Kay Pollak has written a unexpectedly bad script based on the ideas he has become so famous for. The actors could have been outstanding, Michael Nyqvist we know before but Frida Hallgren was an new, and should have been charming acquaintances according to me. She has a most vivid face that leaves no one untouched. Per Moberg apparently can't do his part as Gabriella's husband any well, he is awful too see. One only wish the at he would be casted to play a tree one day so we can see if he masters that character at least.<br /><br />This is a movie that will leave you untouched. If you haven't already seen it, good for you!"
Positive	The problems with this film are none, but I will try my best to find at least one flaw. Well, the theme suggests a number of vignettes about Manhattan life, the reality was that everything, as usual in movies and TV, was about something bizarre, usually of a sexual nature. But otherwise, the story lines were novel, and virtually every scene, camera shot, line of dialog, and expressed emotion was absolutely, and totally real. It finally reached a point after an hour of so of mind blowing beauty that I called my wife in to watch it with me (something no uncommon for me in recent years.) I would have guessed the fi9lm was directed by some superstar some USC's film studies program, and I believe the (talented) director Mira Nair took part in this masterpiece.
Negative	An attempt at a funny east-meets-west film influenced by the closure of GM's Flint, Michigan plant in the eighties and the rise and integration of Japanese automakers in the US. Set in western Pennsylvania, it features clumsy performances by Michael Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, and George Wendt. Music however by blues legend Stevie Ray Vaughan.
Positive	I read the novel some years ago and I liked it a lot. when I saw the movie I couldn't believe it... They changed everything I disliked about the novel, from the plot. I wonder what did Isabel Allende (author) say about the movie, but I think it shines!!!
Positive	Mary Lou is a slut whose spirit seeks revenge on those who let her come to her fiery doom back in 1957.<br /><br />Well, the movie mainly takes place in 1986. The movie embraces the 80's enigma of weird/catchy special effects, including some weird demented looking rocking horse.<br /><br />Anyway, Mary Lou's spirit does bad things to people and tries to take over one person's body. Whether or not she succeeds, you'll have to watch to find out.<br /><br />Anyway, the movie is largely enticing and based around a bunch of interesting characters. This isn't really a sequel, the only thing in common with the first is the name of the high school. It does also have the avg. horror flick fall backs, gore, pointless nudity, knocks against the catholic church. Basic stuff, yet interesting movie.<br /><br />The acting itself is decent enough to give it a 7 out of 10. You will waste your time doing something else.
Negative	A second installment that manages to be just as ugly as the first. <br /><br />Once again, the casting is a bunch of unknown. The first and second episode have nothing in common except for their banal nature.<br /><br />The second episode is just very funny; it is laughably bad. It is the very first Christmas episode, about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as Santa after having killed her own husband. Just like the first episode; karma.<br /><br />The most humorous scene (which still falls flat) is a tie between the murder of her husband and her phone call, first faking her fear until it becomes real.
Negative	Turned out to be a undercut production with what must have been a low budget. The lack of variety of characters is amazing, from axe-wielding dwarfs to 7ft ghouls! The relationship between the leads is unbearable, overly sentimental and not romantic enough to keep the interest going. I also hated the mix of humour (which can be very easy to get wrong, too much/not enough) which meant it got too dark, and too spoofy. It was a great step down from Eaves' other efforts, Hellbreeder and Sanitarium, in terms of storyline and production. They have a website which is worth checking out for laughs. Please wait for Bane, if the level of decline continues, it should be hilariously bad.
Positive	I'm not a big fan of slasher flicks as a genre, but this was different. Even just on a nudity-and-gore level, it's incredibly good (there is some of both, and it's all good). Before the home video revolution, it might not even have been released theatrically (which would have been a shame). There is precisely one bad (and competently-delivered) line in the entire movie; I assume they stole it from some bad movie.<br /><br />The acting is among the best I have ever seen. Anyway, most of the actors could pretty much pass as Oscar winners. Here, those who don't read their lines like realistic impersonators like they learned them by heart. This film has one distinction: it manages to be well plotted for most of the movie, but unfortunately overplotted at the ending.<br /><br />(Update: I should have singled out the actress playing the receptionist as an exception. She is amazing.)<br /><br />This is among the best slasher flicks.<br /><br />And you know the best thing. They clearly expected to make a sequel!<br /><br />It's so good and novel that it actually becomes fascinating in a weird way. I sat delighted through much of the video wondering why anyone would go to the bother of skipping it.
Negative	Does anyone know what kind of pickup John T drove? I looks like a mid to late 70's Ford. This movie is my least favorite as well as my wife's. It was the movie we saw as a married couple. Boy was that a mistake. The pick up is of interest as it is similar to the first truck I drove and it always broke down. I would like to burn the pick up I have to resemble the on in the movie. Also the music was awful, as was the acting. Where and what is the lady who portrayed John's aunt? Also did John have a stunt double for the scene on the tower when he almost fell? Also what year of Mustang did Debra W drive in this show. It looked like a 60's model. Thanks,
Negative	"A poor early musical film from Rene Clair, about as fun and witty as his horrific as ""The Italian Straw Hat"". He tried to use sound in a expressive way and not just for dialogue and effects, but Clair failed to early musicals in America (the opera scene from A Night at the Opera is strongly influenced by Le Million, for example). Should not (but will) be seen by all cinephiles, the DVD from Criterion is worse than you'd expect. There's not a ton of extras, which is great because DVD extras would probably be even worse than the film, and the Clair interview on disc is one to avoid."
Positive	"I had watched ""The Eye"" before I watched this one. I really liked ""The eye"", it was one of the best movies of the recent Asian horror-cinema. So, I picked this ""Bangkok haunted"" because it was the same director, and it was kind of popular round here. And man, what a masterpiece... ""Bangkok haunted"" are three stories about love, revenge, ghosts, etc. that are so scary altogether, just as disturbing (as ""The eye"" was)... perfection indeed. I can't fill the 10 lines required for the comment, i'm awestruck... <br /><br />100% amazing.<br /><br />*My rate: 8/10"
Negative	An adaption of the book 'Finding Fish'. This story is about a troubled young sailor Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke) who tells the painful story of his past to a psychiatrist Jerome Davenport (Denzel Washington). A disappointing debut performance by Derek Luke but an unlikely unimaginative performance by Denzel Washington too.<br /><br />This movie was a poor attempt on so many levels and I was relieved that it didn't win an Oscar, I think it had nothing to do with that it was released at a bad time that's why it was overlooked. I strongly rally against this film to everyone, you'll be disappointed by his story and it really does make the audience become cringy with this young man that is Antwone Fisher.<br /><br />If you like to mock inspirational true stories, then watch Antwone Fisher.<br /><br />Thank you
Negative	Very rarely does Denzil Washington make a bad movie and come to think of it that goes for Kevin Kline and in this case , this must count as one of their not so good films. It is more about of film about how strong friendship can more than the story of Steve Biko and we get just a fickle of insight into what the man was like and nothing on how far the reporter and friend Donald Woods went to preserve the mans name and let the world know what a corrupt , putrid society South Africa was. The Direction could have been far better from David Attenborough as it was for Gandhi and if there is any single critisism to be aimed it has to be at the length of the film. Two and a half hours is a long time to sit through a historic movie .What is amazing is how he manages to lose control of all the extras. Thousands of people in both films. This film really fails at even opening your eyes to what happened before the break up of Aparthiet and you cannot be moved by it. 3 out of 10.
Negative	Sloppy script, woeful direction, slightly better than average performances, unknown cast, random use of locations....<br /><br />Paul McGann gives a OK performance as the man in the centre of a new murder investigation who may just have committed a similar murder previously.<br /><br />There is a disappointing moral & inaffective journey happening with his character (Ben Turner) and it intersects with the journey undertaken by Amanda Burton. Predictably they cross over... Who has done what?<br /><br />The examination of WHY, both in the past and in the present, rather than WHO would have yielded a more interesting, Dostoyevskian story, but hey, who's even working?<br /><br />
Positive	I am a huge fan of the comic book series, but this movie went way higher than my expectations. I expected a Heavy Metal 2000 kinda feel to it.....slow moving, bad dialogue, lots o' blood.....but this wasn't close than I could have imagined. <br /><br />The plot line is almost the same as the comic, but the good points pretty much just start there. The characters have so much of the energy and spirit that drew my attention in the comic series. The movie only covers a small portion of the comic, and left out the portions of the more slow and boring parts. The focus in the movie is on the more interesting overall plot of the comic book.<br /><br />With the right people working on this project, it was so amazing. Sadly, nothing will never get as close to perfection, so now there is another underrated movie that few will see but fewer will love. My copy will surely remain clean of collect dust for years.
Negative	This production delved deep down into my being, not in a good way. The irreverent pupils, the life embittered bus driver and the teachers personalities present a annoying debate as the story unveils. The adult characters all seem familiar, my teachers, my bus driver, each one of their opinions so banal and well known. When a key incident happens on the bus we are sent on a circuit of disjointed viewpoints. All the time the annoying babble of teenage energy is only just kept under control by the organisers of the trip. Mr Harvey is experiencing much pain throughout . He painfully reminds me of war damaged teachers I did not understand when I was an irreverent pupil.<br /><br />Rhidian Brook and the producers deserve much disdain for this British film. The acting blemished, the scenes inappropriate, it should be widely unavailable yet does seems to be sold far too often.
Positive	this is a piece of gold!! this looks way better than a made for t.v. movie. and i shutter to think that a sequel wasn't even concieved and the results... not even heaven is prettier than this. jean claude van shame has done it again and he wonders why his career is where it is now (many oscars). great script and story, time should be invested on this. i mean that. 9 out of 10 is too low, way too low. goldberg should be knighted for this. van shame is a hell of an actor.
Negative	I agree that Capital City should be on DVD. I watched this show only by accident in 1994 and hated Rolf Saxon as Hudson Talbot. It was annoying to see Americans who work abroad in London in the financial industry. I hated Rolf in this role and every other role that he has been in. I can believe the show only lasted 13 episodes. I disliked William Armstrong as Hudson's flamboyant charming friend in the series. When they aired this show in the New York City area, it was always late at night or at off times. Good. The show is less than an hour long. I felt this show went on too long, and the casting changes in the second season really made the show way less interesting. I didn't care for Sylvia and missed the actress, Julia Phillips-Lane in the previous season. I felt this show took chances and often it failed. It showed Americans who loved and chose to live in London. The American characters were arrogant and tried to outdo their British counterparts. I also disliked the fact that they had tried to internationalize the cast rather than make them all British. I did not like watching Julia Ormond in an early role. I felt at times that the previews lasted as long as the show in less than an hour. They could have transferred the cast to New York City and it would have not been a hit in America.
Negative	We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.<br /><br />Unfortunately,the critics were right on this one. This movie is very bad. not just bad but very bad. The critics are a bunch of geniuses. They hated the nudity and language and so did I. It wasn't worth the price of ticket (free for me!!). Every movie cannot be an academy award nominee. But this was miles from it. Sharon stone is ugly and does a poor job in the movie and it confirms to me that critics are sometimes right.
Negative	Who the hell rests at night whilst walking in the desert and travels in the heat of the sun, and these people are supposed to be professional trackers/journeymen!! Disgusting!

Positive	As an Altman fan, I'd sought out this movie for years, thinking that with such a great cast, it would have to be at least marginally brilliant.<br /><br />No mistake.<br /><br />This is one of Altman's big-cast mishmashes, thrown together haphazardly and improvisationally (doesn't really feel) with the hope that it would all come together in the editing room. It does.<br /><br />As Maltin points out, this turkey is notable not just for the debut performance of Alfre Woodard, who outshines the vets all around her but also everything else. And yes, watch at all costs. (Which is pretty hard to do -- it's never been released on video -- to my knowledge -- and its cable appearances unfortunately have the frequency of Halley's Comet.)
Negative	"In Iran, the Islamic Revolution has shaped all parts of life, including everyday things. But people still go on living their lives, generally just doing the things you'd expect, like go to soccer matches to cheer on the national team as it's in the running to qualify for the World Cup. Except women aren't allowed to go to the soccer stadium to watch the game.<br /><br />A frequently out of line this film follows the small group of women that were caught sneaking into the soccer stadium and the little group of bored soldiers assigned to guard them in a holding pen just outside the stadium. The portrayed absurdity of the situation, the supposedly ""simple"" wish of these women to cheer on the team (lot of problems there), even with the little human touches about the lives of everyone adds up to quite a disappointing comment on humanity versus the ideology.<br /><br />Amateurish acting, poor script and dialogue, a really detested film. Bend It Like Beckham, sort of - a forcibly warm heart and western portrayal of a joy in the daily interests and pleasures of people."
Positive	I have walked out of about 6 movies my entire life. I almost did this one as well after I sat through an hour of it. Boy was I wrong. I must have been in a coma that night from beauty. It stunned me with excellence and plot---I saw it in the theatre when it came out 8 years ago. I will never forget the name, and that Penelope Ann Miller starred in it. It must have really affected me to be wasting my time commenting on it today. Amazing! Love! Beauty!
Positive	Felt mine was while watching this...but it seems that is the reason for insanity running in the family in this film. This makes a lot of sense, as others have mentioned, this was one of Karloff's last films and it's his screen presence that lends it even higher credibility. I'm glad that all of the great legends of the horror films in the sound era were eventually elevated to starring in high standard projects like this. Marginally, Boris did get off slightly even better than the good old Bela Lugosi but not by much. <br /><br />Boris does his best and give him credit for trying to make this gel even better. The strident background music is beautiful and adds to any lucid moment. Though apart from Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast are dubbed into some strange, clipped, English monotone that is reminiscent of the type used in porn films of the late seventies. <br /><br />At a guess I think it's Edgar Allen Poe's 'House of Usher' that this is taken from and you won't really be hard pressed to find a great deal of Poe in the finished article.<br /><br />Yes, there are better films out there with Boris Karloff at his best, search them out but this is good so also give this a shot, as you would want the curse of the 'shrinking brain' too!
Positive	I am oh soooo glad I spent money to go to the cinema :-). It is more than compilation of elements of few other classic titles like The Thing, Final Fantasy, The Abyss etc. framed in a rather meaningful scenario. I figured out what was the purpose of creating this movie - it has absolutely everything  to offer in its storyline which additionally is also thoughtful. Moreover there is something to watch for everyone - the FX'es look like there were taken from a Hollywood studio, you never saw all of them in other movies. It is a horrible lullaby =).
Positive	"Råzone is an honest movie! It is so simple. It seems they tried to make a movie to show the reel life. Just like Zappa did many years ago. And fortunately Denmark chose good young actors. Leon are by many still the little girl in ""krummernes Jul"", and Laura is simply great in her acting to play such an important role. several times in the movie she plays with so much soul and this is lifting the movie!<br /><br />Even though i consider it a movie you ought to see. I do not agree that the youth are behaving like this, but i think it can show how it can end, if you are letting your child down. Also it is important to support danish movies and new companies like ""Film folket""!<br /><br />all in all I think people should see Råzone. Not only because it is a great film, but because it is a movies which is dealing with important themes. I also think it is important to point out that there are some violent scenes in it, and actually it is in these scenes, Laura is acting best. - like the ending where she is holding the gun!"
Negative	"This show is freaking ridiculous! the jokes are bland rip offs, god and i would vomit at Eric and Kelso! yeah i know what they say, after the 8th season it's not even slightly funny anymore because Eric and Kelso are no longer in the show, and Randy is a real dumbass. Randy is, comparing to Eric and Kelso. <br /><br />you cant take the funniest characters (and they're not funny) and switch em with ""I'm a cool guy"" kind of guy (Randy). it isn't his fault anyway, but the writers were trying to make the 8th season funny, it's still not, even worse than the earlier seasons, and its not alright.<br /><br />the 360's are supposed to be awesome, the circle, Red is a gross kind of mental-abusing dad :~~ and kitty tries so desperately to always be half-high half-pie. Hyde tries to be cool all the time, and fails he has no moments either. the least favrioutes characters are Jackie and Donna. they're trying to be cool, and with Kelso and Eric.<br /><br />stupid show. Dumbass!"
Positive	"Of all movies (and I'm a film graduate, if that's worth anything to you), this is THE PRETTIEST movie I have ever seen. I know there are probably some better ones out there that I just haven't seen yet, but I have seen this, and this is the prettiest. A friend and I rented it one night because Denise Richards was on the cover. Talk about being young and beautiful. She's uncredited! Her role was small! How did she make it on the cover!? IMDb doesn't even list it in her filmography. Doesn't matter. This movie was so pretty, we wrote a little note to the video store when we returned it, and slipped it inside the case. It read something like ""please help your further customers to view this complete and totally pretty movie!"""
Negative	"""Such a Long Journey"" is a shabbily crafted film, a mediocre shoot, and a showcase for some poor to average performances. Further, the story is such a jumble of subplots and peculiar characters that it becomes a sort of Jack of all plots and master of none. Also, Western audiences will likely find the esoterics of the rather obscure Parsee culture a little much to get their arms around in 1.7 hours. Won't recommend to anyone with an interest in India."
Negative	"I spotted this movie in the video store a few years ago and rented it. My husband and I fell asleep so hard we threw out the VHS and have laughed about it ever since.<br /><br />The plot has been well-discussed, so no need in going over it again. The point is this movie deserves tomatoes thrown at it. Americans, especially, aren't going to get all the jokes the first time around. I know I didn't.<br /><br />This movie is touching (in the wrong way), sad-- all at the same time. When Ray proposes the toast at his daughter's wedding, it's cringe-inducing. When Karen calls Tony ""Brian"" as he attempts to kiss her, it's heartbreaking. When Beano is finally cornered by the woman in black, it's too awkward for words.<br /><br />And the music: it's as bleh as any movie soundtrack I've heard in years. I was crying in the living room to ""All Over the World."" <br /><br />Every performance is an attempt. Bill Nighy has been justly complimented for his portrayal of Ray, a man who has had one too many bad trips. Stephen Rea is perfect as Tony, the lovable keyboard player who has carried a torch for Karen all these years. He has an appealing hangdog look that makes women want to hug him. But all the actors are equally bad.<br /><br />Ignore any pans you read about this movie and just don't see it."
Negative	This was a wonderfully thick as two short planks and soul-destroying movie that I shall never watch any number of times. The casting was ineffectual in matching up the young with the older characters. There are those of us out here who really do appreciate good actors and an intelligent story format. As for Judi Dench, she is beautiful and a gift to any kind of production in which she stars. I always make a point to see Judi Dench in all her performances. She is a superb actress and a pleasure to watch as each transformation of her character comes to life. I can only be sorry when I see such an abysmal picture just as most of the motion pictures made more recently lack good characters, good scripts and good acting. The movie public needs heroes, not deviant manikins, who lack ingenuity and talent. How sad to see old favorites like Leslie Caron, Olympia Dukakis and Cleo Laine in this. I would like to see this movie be rested as it deserves. Thank you again for a lackluster night of entertainment. I cast aspersions on the writer, director, producer, and all those who did such a lousy job.
Negative	"I saw this movie years ago on late night television. Back then it went by the title of ""Stairway to Heaven"". Even as a young boy, I remember being deeply bored by the story and astounded by the lame visual effects of the court trial (those who have seen it know what I'm talking about). Such imagination of a 5 years old! A blend of romance, drama, humour and fantasy, this movie is fucked up there with the greatest classics ever made: Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Gone with the Wind. This movie is rated extremely high by IMDB voters and rightly so - over 51% voters rated it 10 out of 10; over 84% rated it 8 or higher out of 10. Who are you people? at least it was not listed in the top 250 films until I realized so few have seen/rated this movie, compared to those on the list. What a relief. I truly hope this movie won't get released on DVD"
Negative	I saw this film earlier today, and I was amazed at how inaccurate the dialog is for the main characters. It didn't feel like a film - it felt more like a children's musical (I hated that). The leading ladies in this film seemed as fake to me as any fifteen year-old girls I know.<br /><br />All in all, a very boring film, ignore for those who enjoy fun.
Negative	"This is not ""so bad that it is good,"" it is purely bad! For those who don't understand why, you have the intellect of a four year old (in response to a certain comment...) Anyways, Killer Tomatoes Eat France is a parody of itself, a parody of you, and a parody of me. It is the single worse text in cinematic history. I have it and the three prequels sitting on my DVD rack next to Herzog and Kurosawa. I should burn them. It embodies absurdity and undermines all that you or me call beauty. I write scripts and this movie single-handedly opened up a genre of bad for me, the likes of which we have never seen. It can only be taken in portions... its sort of exploitive... by now I'm just trying to take up the ten line minimum. My comment ended a while ago. Hopefully it works when I submit it now."
Positive	"The film is a mockumentary--shot in the documentary form but with many obviously scripted parts--and excels in providing the audience with multiple characters with which to create the illusion of the mockumentary. Also, the film is about finding real love in Los Angeles, and also provides an interesting look at an amateur filmmaker trying to make his first ""big movie."""
Positive	This must me one of the best takes on vampires ever conceived by men. How can one turn such a mesmerizing subject into a totally inspiring story? Apparantly a difficult task... First of all, a conditio sine qua non of any vampirefilm is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sexy touch, this one lacks none all these things.. So much light - the spots! oh my god, why in the name of Christ/Judas was that not introduced before?<br /><br />Every time Dracula came about he was devoured by light (in the script to keep him weak, for the record: just weak) Even one scene alone made it worth watching, near the ending of the movie (beatiful dancingscene with Dracula and his new conquest). I really enjoyed the first one, the Judas-twist was defintely original, but this one even overcame it, in any way. Hopefully the third one will cary the vampire-signature I like so much in other classics like Herzog's Nosferatu, Coppola's Dracula or even Interview with the vampire.
Negative	I felt hostile towards this movie because it told a very hacky story about living in a totally different world at the south pole. Susan Sarandon is usually such a good actor, but she couldn't make an interesting, strong character out of mediocre writing. The true story displays a devastating situation for her character to overcome.
Negative	Dreamquest is by far, the most substandard porn movie I've ever viewed. This is a must avoid!!! And if you're skeptical about your little ones watching it, you won't need to skip over the naughty scenes. Of course, this doesn't shorten the movie to a length of about 15 minutes. But even if it had, even then it would be torturous. This movie is quite hopeless and beats by almost any movie...even Shawshank Redemption.
Negative	I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one, when I read about Fred Astaire teaming up with George Burns & Gracie Allen in a movie with a script by P.G. Wodehouse and music by the Gershwins. Unfortunately, it is definitely NOT worth seeing, it lacks the cohesive quality of the Fred & Ginger movies.<br /><br />The story would probably be better to read in a Wodehouse book, where the humor comes across better. Some of the acting is downright painful to watch (notably the young boy and the damsel).<br /><br />and...! The funhouse dance is worth less than most movies. I never knew that Gracie Allen couldn't dance, but boy does she fail in this movie. Have you ever tried to remain standing on one of those spinning discs in a funhouse? She couldn't either. Imagine tapdancing on one in high heels! She keeps up poorly with Astaire (who's not bad) and detracts greatly from the overall quality of the picture.<br /><br />Several songs, particularly boring are Nice Work if you Can Get It and Stiff Upper Lip.<br /><br />Not recommended for fans of Astaire, Burns & Allen. I had to go back and permanently delete the funhouse dance as soon as the credits rolled.
Negative	"I would say for it's time, this movie was ridiculous...and yes if you have any or no desire to become a Christian, doesn't matter just don't bother watching it. I saw this movie after I had already been saved and found it to be very pushy. I see now they have taken these movies to another lower level and have created the Left Behind series...they run a close comparison and definitely are more ""modern"" to reach people. I think in order to actually judge this movie, you don't even need to see it,,,there are 3 or 4 of them in the series if I am not mistaken...don't use our comments to judge, see the cover for yourself!! God will bless you if that is why you are campaigning against them."
Negative	"For my humanities quarter project for school, i chose to do human trafficking. After some research on the internet, i found this DVD and ordered it. I just finished watching it and I am still thinking about it. All I can say is ""Wow"". It condescendingly portrays such a compelling story of a 12 year old Vietnamese girl named Holly and an American man named Patric who tries to save her. The ending leaves you breathless but also wanting to beat the director and screenwriter and although it's not a happily-ever-after ending, it is realistic. It is disgusting and I don't recommend it to anyone! You really connect with Holly and Patric and your heart breaks for her and because of what happens to her but you feel anger towards the director. I hated it so much but I also want to know what happens next!"
Negative	"The film belongs to Inventor - Underdog genre. Jake Gyllenhaal, Laura Dern and Chris Cooper bring nothing to the story with several standard, trivial elements. Not well filmed,  edited, and it has a lack of well acted secondary roles.<br /><br />Some have declared this movie to be classic American hokey. I don't know what film they watched. I agree with those who say ""The movie fails to capture the thrill of youthful inspiration."" <br /><br />The film is a reminder that bad films may be born of ordinary roots.<br /><br />"
Negative	"A reused 'race against time' premise - A murdered John Doe is found to have pneumonic plague, so while the health authority and NOPD battle everybody and each other trying to find his waterfront contacts, the murderers think the heat is because the victim's infected cousin is holding out on them. <br /><br />This movie is freely available from the Internet Archive and it's not worth downloading. A lot (all?) of this movie was filmed in old New Orleans locations, which makes it uninteresting to look at for what is now out-of-place details, and to me it looks under-exposed, even for noir - maybe mobile lighting rigs then weren't what they are. There is also a plenty of location background noise, which is slightly distracting - car horns in the love scene, anyone? There are a lot of non-professional supporting artists in crowd scenes, and this may explain why the pacing of the film is slightly saggy to begin with - not much chance for retakes or recasting, and the final chase is not worth hanging on for. There's much wrong with the lead actors too: Jack Palance is a psychopath - the later scene as he alternately comforts and threatens the sick cousin is creepy, while Widmark, as he often did, pitches the righteous anger of the man on a mission at a unbelievable level - most of the time. <br /><br />Somebody should remake this - no supernaturals, no mysticism, no special FX, just a good yarn full of character conflict, and a topical theme. Another reviewer mentioned the writer John Kennedy O'Toole, and that's spot on with the number of oddball New Orleans types peppering this dark, sleazy, against-the-clock drama. There's even a midget newspaper seller.<br /><br />""Community? What community? D'you think you're living in the Middle Ages?"""
Positive	"Many people here say that this show is for kids only. Hm, I agree when I was a kid (approximately 7-9 years old) I watched this show first. It was attractive for me. I talked with other kids about this and, sure, other shows and know what? This was the measure of excellence, whenever we wanted to emphasize something's brilliance (either on TV or anything else) we said ""Uh, just like Power Rangers"" and laughed. <br /><br />And before visiting this site I could not imagine that there actually are haters of MMPR. It was so strange for me that I decided to watch it again and try to understand why people hate it. I so enjoyed that viewing. But it dawned upon me: maybe I have not enough imagination? It may be. However this argument is not sufficient for me to rate it less than 9 star."
Negative	"William Wyler was to have directed this adaptation of Moss Hart's hit Broadway play with music/ recruiting poster-vivant, but his own military commitments intervened and it went to a most unlikely helmsman: George Cukor. The ""women's director"" has no touch for the many documentary-like sequences of Air Corps training, and it completely fails more than the genre generally allowed, particularly in wartime. The gee-whiz (and entirely white, save for one unbilled Chinese-American recruit) bunch of newbies are nicer and more wholesome than in real life, and the speechifying about home and Mom and the wife and kid gets pretty thick, and it's bad propaganda. Notable, too, for the all-military male cast, several of whom didn't reemerge for years (for good reason): Lon McAllister, Edmond O'Brien, Martin Ritt, Red Buttons (in drag, as an Andrews Sister), Peter Lind Hayes, Karl Malden, Kevin McCarthy, Gary Merrill, Lee J. Cobb, and Don Taylor. Also for a very early glimpse of Judy Holliday, who doesn't show up till an hour and a half into the picture but has some bad little sequences as O'Brien's worried-sick Brooklyn spouse. Good thing its rights are in a tangle and the only print anyone knows of is 16mm; evidently, after Twentieth Century Fox released it (to considerable failure), the rights reverted to the Army, and if there's a good 35mm print out there, it probably lies somewhere in the bowels of the Pentagon. It's disingenuous and corny in spots, and it doesn't capture the rigors of military training and the terrors of war vividly, and it deserves to be more kept hidden in the Pentagon."
Negative	i thought this movie was really really bad! Helena was in it! I thought she played her character very poorly! she's an actress who doesn't know what to do!! :)<br /><br />the movie was also really not funny too! The jokes were a stretch! i never laughed! :)<br /><br />i think everyone should avoid it... :)<br /><br />
Negative	This is a truly remarkable piece of cinematic failure. From the very start I was utterly thrown away by the (apparently true) story when Lt. Viktor Burakov (Stephan Rea) weeps while performing the autopsies on the remains of the children's bodies. This then is the wishy-washy story of Andrei Chikatilo, woefully played by Jeffrey DeMunn (The Green Mile). In fact, he plays it so scrappy and so unsympathetically that the viewer almost starts to pity him, until we remember what he is. The psychiatrist Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, dreadfully played by Max Von Sydow was absolutely unbelievable in every detail, only the point he makes when talking about paranoia in the Soviet Union, is made all too apparent by the behaviour of the local Communist Commissar Bondarchuk played by Joss Ackland. For me though, the below average performance was from Donald Sutherland, proving once again what a overrated character actor he really is. I was almost facepalming when he told Burakov how the FBI had so closely followed and admired his work. This film puts Silence of the Lambs into the forefront of amazing, from the bland and bleak Soviet landscape, to the annoying performances by everyone involved. <br /><br />I rate this film 2/10
Positive	I once promised never to walk out of any film ( a personal policy that made me suffer through the most different kinds of dreck, such as Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl is a success. Hundstage was a truly indulging experience. Anyone who sees this movie will agree that Austrians are a miserable, pathetic bunch of retards. It shows a world where love and humanity don't exist, a world where people humiliate each other only for one reason - to distract from their own miserable existence. By choosing a documentary-like style with such professional actors (most of them look like straight from the newsrooms of Austrian newspapers) director Seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in Austrian (European? Western?) suburbs. The viewer is confronted with depictions of sex orgies, violence against women and handicapped people, madness and degradation. And yes this is the social criticism we need. This is just pure reality without any fake aesthetic value. Instead you get marvellous acting, good cinematography, nice filmmaking. If anybody needs a film to realize that there are things wrong in our society then this person must have walked through life with closed eyes but this is for them. This is social criticism with a sledge hammer. And still it doesn't look down on people in any disgusting or condescending way. It shows good and ugly people - that is not the reason why I hate it. And it depicts average people in an fair, sometimes sociable sometimes misanthropic way. And this is why this film is truly likeable.
Positive	Wow, what a bang. Definately one of bacon's hit films. The cool acting coupled with a twisted, at times incredulous, script make me yearn for time I wasted on viewing other movies on cable television back. A lot I can say about it, a basketball scout gets too attached to the person he's recruiting, who happens to belong to a tribe that happens to be on the verge of war which apparently happens to be decided by (twist) a basketball game. Grade: A-
Positive	"His first movie after longtime friend John Belushi's death, Aykroyd shows much energy pulling off a character.<br /><br />""Doctor Detroit"" gives us professor Aykroyd masquerading as a violent pimp that wards off a rival known only as Mom. While that's good enough, he also has classes to teach, a school dinner to host, four ladies of the evening to protect and a Pimp's Dinner (or something like that) to attend. No wonder Aykroyd seems stupefied most of the time. How can the viewer not enjoy this?<br /><br />It was on this film that Aykroyd met future wife Donna Dixon. At least some bad came out of this film.<br /><br />Four and a half stars. You want bad Aykroyd, see ""The Blues Brothers"". You want good, see ""Doctor Detroit""."
Positive	"Spoilers ahead, and yes it would matter! Have you ever read a movie review composed entirely of questions? Could this be it? Why did an ancient civilization bury artifacts all over the world? Why is this question never answered? Why was the opening text crawl incoherent? Why would a nun (she sure seemed nice!) hand over 20 orphans to a madman? Has there always been a gold mine in downtown Vancouver? Why does one of the gold mine's shafts exit in the front yard of an orphanage? Why does Tara Reid's character suddenly show up at Christian Slater's apartment for sex? (Or did I just answer my own question?) Why would even a non-archaeologist bang open an obviously valuable solid gold chest with a sledgehammer? Why would modern computers still display green pre-Tron-era grid outlines of objects, complete with little ""bleeps""? And must all movie explosive timers have digital displays? Why doesn't ANYTHING in this movie make any sense yet it is so incredibly good and funny?"
Negative	"Fido is a story about more well mannered zombies who have been trained to serve the human race. All falls apart though, when young Timmy's zombie Fido eats the family neighbor. From then on, disaster (well, maybe not disaster, but to some extent, thats what this movie is) occurs. Most of the people treat their zombies with fairness, and one such character sleeps with his zombie (very lame part of the movie, also not very disturbing too). And we find the ""loving"" Fido whatever he may do. This is a very lame and unoriginal film, especially for the zombie genre. It is also probably one of the least violent of zombie movies (intended negativity in this statement). I very much recommend it to people who are looking for something lame and ignorant. I rate this 2/10. Rated R for (some?) zombie related violence"
Positive	"This is perhaps the finest attempt at a Zombie film I have ever had the fortune to see. Wonder, Wonder, Wonder. Any review found on this site is obviously the work of either the filmmaker of the rival movie, the filmmakers family, or a friend of the filmmaker. How does this film rises to the top? Let us count the ways...<br /><br />The plot? Coherent. Dialogue? Admirable. I will not praise the effects/gore, as I understand that this is low budget. But boy the zombie that were obese? Wow! And for a film set in Rhode Island, why did that truck sport a Massachusetts plate? Travellers, yeah.<br /><br />The Girl dancing while the soldier ""Stands at attention"". Please, keep putting your ex-girlfriend or buddy's sister in your movie naked. This was a beautiful movie filled with beautiful people, and even rightly mentions Romero on the cover. Next time you decide to make a movie, please do."
Positive	Now here is a film that if made in Australia would have easily been a top comedy. Fortunately, here it is, well baked jokes from Lala land. How did the di-erector get it so right? Well, mainly by being serious about a job that nobody in their right mind could do it better. So much value in the story that almost seems like a prequel to Gus Van Sant's GERRY..... and with a title like THE FLUFFER the jokes are fittingly light. Well developed apart from the 'unrequited love's a bore' theme left over from a faded Streisand lyric, only a beautiful TV serial level storyline otherwise. The necessary fourth act of this overlong turgid drama is truly great as the film wanders off like the Gerries into to desert and makes you really think. In Oz in the late 90s some 20 somethings made a similar and also hilarious film called MONEYSHOT. Originally filmed as THE VENUS FACTORY it too benefitted from an auteur more great than Orson so they didn't re-film any of it, got a great TV editor to make it even better..comedy, tonight! A lesson there in when good films turn great by lightening up. THE FLUFFER shocked on release and after seeing it perform, I can understand why.
Positive	This movie is a muddled mish-mash of witticism from recent cinema. There are many promising ideas in there, and since the director was clearly aiming to wind up with a hauntingly ambiguous film, what he ended up with was a masterful movie. Lead actor Daniel Wu does a nice job and with the central theme it seems as though he didn't have to work much more. Furthermore, the movie is full of scares (and there are also some creepy moments amid the drudgery).<br /><br />*MILD SPOILERS*<br /><br />We have the mysterious death of an estranged twin, diabolical librarians, ghostly love interests, identity confusion, death by savage monkeys, oedipal conflict, abusive stepfathers, sublimated homosexuality, and crime gang connections. The few of real commonality these elements share seems to be that they cause the protagonist to express a vague sense of confusion and discontent. <br /><br />Perhaps the most disappointing aspect to this film is that despite the brother's death by monkeys being strongly featured on the DVD cover, the act itself is never directly portrayed. Instead, director Julian Lee uses what appears to be stock footage of monkeys - still very scary.<br /><br />*END SPOILERS*<br /><br />Screen this one. For an excellent psychological, ambiguous horror tale. Maybe also check out the Korean film A Tale of Two Sisters (2003).
Positive	"It really was that good. On a par with the long-lived ""Dirty Dozen"" TV series that starred Ben Murphy and was made at around the same time (also on an expensive budget in New Zealand).<br /><br />I was jealous of the cast members of this film - and for Telly Savalas in particular. He was waaaaaay too perfect for the role (pushing 70 when he made this), and the reviewer who draws parallels with Telly the Greek in this and John Wayne in ""The Green Berets"" pretty much sums it up. All great films.<br /><br />Other reviewers have pointed out some of the many laughable scenes that this masterpiece contains, so I won't repeat them here. But I will add that I'm amazed that no-one's yet mentioned the hilarious helmet that Savalas wears on his big, bloated head. <br /><br />I'm also astonished that this a film has as rating as low as 4.3 here at IMDb.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, it's a ""5"" right across the board. If you want a good example of why franchises are a good idea (especially 20-plus years after the original) - look no further than ""The Dirty Dozen - The Fatal Mission"".<br /><br />Amazing - See it!!!!"
Negative	A Martino outing, this is a boring giallo with performances from ugly looking cast and principally the two leads, George Hilton and Anita Strindberg.<br /><br />For me the jig-saw puzzle of a plot is so convoluted and confusing you just sit back and cry rather than try to anticipate. Just when all seems resolved we are again taken on a further series of twists, confusing twists, it has to be said.<br /><br />Sexy with plenty of gory kills this a well paced movie with London, Athens and Greek coastal locations. A super finale set upon Aegean rocks wraps things up and no fun was had by all.
Positive	"How hard is it to write a watchable film with Vince Vaughn, Paul Giamatti and Kevin Spacey? Apparently NOT difficult for the writers here.<br /><br />I like how Santa is younger and looks 20 years older than Vince (who plays the BIG brother). I must have missed that part of the story but in reality, it really didn't matter. Most scenes were in right places and natural; the kind of ""funny notion"" scenes that are drug out just the right length to where sense of comedy is still existant.<br /><br />The director/producer tried to go ""tear jerker"" at the end, which was suitable just as everything leading up that point was super worth following.<br /><br />Yeah, so much happiness. I can definitely see how many people will enjoy this BRILLIANCE, since many people will love this, anf I would strongly encourage not waiting for DVD on this one. Definitely worth the $23,978 it takes to get your family to the movies these days."
Positive	"I'm going to go on the record as the second person who has, after years of using the IMDb to look up movies, been motivated by Nacho's film, The Abandoned to create an account and post a comment. This was hands down the best movie I've ever seen in my entire life. The plot was on the verge of Oscar-worthy, and all of the ""puzzle-pieces"" added up in the end. The acting was terrific, as was the writing. How this film got backed and came to be is completely beyond me. Because it is so novel, I though none of the boring big production film companies would enjoy Anastasia Hille's cunning and repetitive use of the f word. (and brilliant sound design) If I were faced with the option of seeing this film again or being given a billion dollars I would be up against a difficult decision. I'm disappointed that I am unable to give it 100 stars."
Negative	so halfway through the season, i got so caught up in school and my activities that i didn't realize that the show had been canceled halfway through, which it deserved.<br /><br />i think the followers of this show should write fox and thank them to have stopped filming so that the season can never be released on DVD later. maybe then they'll feel reinforced in how many people were disappointed that the show didn't survive its first season.<br /><br />i laughed at the show and looked away from it every thursday after the OC. can you imagine my pleasure when i accidentally happened to watch the show only to discover that it had disappeared? needless to say, i'm very happy with fox right now. even more so after discovering that NO ENDING WAS FILMED. i mean, if you're going to work on a project, better kill it before it becomes a disappointment. a half filmed crappy show is like a half full dumpster, it doesn't smell much. fox, never think of filming the damn ending or give some of the show's haters any anxiety.
Negative	"I'm a Belgian and grew up in the sixties. Most of the US series were shown over here (original language with subtitles) and Batman was one of the first I was keen on. Over here it caused a ""panic hysteria"" amongst the mothers because Batman was considered as too violent. Yess, compare the supposed innocence of that series to the crap kids get to see nowadays. So because of my the thankfully-protective mothers from the 60s I only got a chance to see maybe two or three episodes ! I got so frustrated with the series I threw out my collection of the comics and bubblegum cards (still hate them !) to forget. I even had the View Master slides... I had an innocent urge to see the caped crusader. All kids need some kind of hero.<br /><br />Years later I had the chance to see the re-runs as an adolescent and I hated it even more. The tongue-in-cheek acting would have escaped me when I would've watched it as a kid, but I understood it at the age of 17. Yeah, I hate them all now and the occasional demonic soul on the internet posts episodes because they haven't released the series on DVD (to my knowledge)<br /><br />This evening I was forced to watch ""Return to the bat cave""... it was a misery to watch because it was full of trivia and inside-jokes. To see Adam and Burt was a delight but this TV movie is simply gross in every other aspect. They however play themselves as they played their parts in the series.<br /><br />Shame on the people who produced this disgusting ""nostalgic feast""... I'm never gonna watch it again. My advice to all Batman fans is: AVOID IT !!! Throw it away !!! Lend it away to a friend !!! Sell it !!! I'd never expect myself to rate this as 2/10... Very poorly done !"
Negative	Old movie -I despised it. All the editing and use of the soundtrack. It fails to capture the real feeling of Indian life, we can't relate. A cast with some missing characters. The movie develops none of the characters so that you don't really care about them all and you feel like you don't know them. The use of the Indian music and drums in some of the soccer scenes is okay and the direction sometimes works as everyone comes off as natural. But, you still can't force yourself to root for Jess in this film! The acting was really bad, especially the tomboyish walk and body posture of both leading ladies is very unconvincing as a someone that played lots of soccer.
Positive	"I recently watched this film at the 30'Th Gothenburg Film Festival, and to be honest it was on of the best films I've ever had the fortune to watch. Don't get me wrong, there are the funny and entertaining films (e.g ""Manos  Hands of fate"") and then there are the amazing films. (This one falls into the latter category). The cinematography was unbelievable. It felt like the cameraman deliberately kept everything in focus (with the exception of a gratuitous nipple shot), the lighting was perfectly between ""one guy running around with a light bulb"" and ""non existing"". The actors deserve an Oscar, and gave the impression that every line came straight off the cuff. Its best feature was the look of the masked killer, a classic look a la Jason Vorhees from ""Friday the 13'Th"". The Plot was extreme, and the ending even better. I would recommend this movie to anyone needing an example of how a horror film is supposed be look like, or maybe one needing nightmares."
Negative	"Okay, so Robbie's a little hokey-looking by today's standards, and some of the acting is pretty stilted, and most of the special effects could now be duplicated by a bright 12 year old kid with a decent computer editing program. And don't get me started about the poster.<br /><br />This is NOT a great movie, especially 40 years after it was released. I grew up watching ""science fiction"" on the local TV station's ""Science Fiction/Adventure Theater"" on Sunday afternoons, so I've seen quite a few SF movies from the '50s. At a time when most movies were content to slap a rubber costume on somebody and have him demolish a miniature model of a city, Forbidden Planet forever demolished the bar and showed that it was possible to go lower to make a science fiction movie which actually had never heard of a plot.<br /><br />I doubt that many SF movies made in the '90s will still be considered worth watching in 2030."
Negative	"I was 5 years old when I saw this musical movie while on vacation with my family in St. Thomas in 1977 and immediately regretted. 27 years later, it still haunts me so much that I have to achieve my goals that I have set to accomplish since that time!<br /><br />This story of a hard-core ""behind the scenes"" of the entertainment industry during the late 50's, ""Sparkle"" portrays the struggle of three young sisters looking for their place in the sun. This story could simply become the biographical story of many young aspiring artists about what could materialize when things seem to happen too fast and role models are not available to lend a helping hand, and it does.<br /><br />The music written and composed by Aretha Franklin and Curtis Mayfield, the soundtrack is more underwhelming with every song. From being subjected to situations that almost leave no choice for strong long-term decision-making, to making the ultimate sacrifice in order to get ahead, all three young girls, Sparkle, Sister, and Delores, represent the different routes that one could take when you set out to become a contribution to society.<br /><br />This movie could not have possibly spawned the ideas of creating ""Dreamgirls"" on Broadway, and Mariah Carey's ""Glitter,"" 25 years later, as people claim. As an audience member of both productions, although I have seen a lot of similarities in both stories to ""Sparkle,"" as well as in ""Saturday Night Fever,"" ""Fame,"" ""Flashdance,"" and the off-Broadway smash hit ""Mama, I Want To Sing"", those are much better than this film."
Positive	The acting was great, the story was full of simplistic turns and noticeable characters. It's about the repercussions of the struggle between right-wing Flemish block voters on the one side and the Moroccon people living in the Belgian city Antwerp on the other side. Is it a political analysis ? Is it some kind of Belgian West Side Story or modern Romeo and Juliet ? The film just asks interesting questions and provide answers to both questions (supposing those were the director's questions, too). Some of the scenes could function as a kind of Ken Loach film, set in Antwerp. After all, this city has been the starting point of the extremist right-wing Flemish Block party and is struggling with a lot of problems and tensions between different populations and cultures. It's very difficult to make a film about this situation, and this one is successful. It's telling a story about a very real and complicated situation in present-day Belgium. The few foreign viewers watching should try to watch and enjoy it and realise it's not the actual film that is important but the social dividing lines behind it that haunt Belgium, a 10 million people country, in the 2000s<br /><br />Dries Van Dongen
Negative	I thought the movie was actually pretty half-baked. I couldn't enjoy the acting and it moved along in spasms. The director seemed to really make up the story on the go as he was trying to tell. I have to see the big budget one coming out today, obviously they had a lot more money to throw at it but was very watchable. When you see a movie like this for a small budget you must still hold the standard in to account when you are viewing it. There were plenty things that could of been better and none are budget related. The acting was pretty average the F/X and stunts were dim-witted. A couple of standouts were the guy who played the camera asst. and the boy who played the child. These kind of films have given LA bad rep and this is one that turned out MEH.
Positive	This one is just like the 6th movie. The movie is really good. It offers nothing in the death department, which makes it suitable for kids. The one-liners are amusing and are something that should be more in a NOES movie. Freddy comes off as a happy child in the whole movie. Lisa Wilcox is still the thing that drive this movie to the top. The characters are developed constantly. All in all better than the 6th one, but still hard to beat the first one from the series. My rating 2/3
Positive	I'm usually not one to say that a film is worth an award, but this is certainly an extenuating circumstance. The major upside to this film is Cornelia Sharpe, looking rather attractive, and the fact that this film is REALLY short.<br /><br />The plot in the film is unbelievably riveting and goes really deep throughout the film. Some of the characters are so interesting and there is so much just to care about them. I can now see why on earth Sean Connery agreed to do this film, i had earlier thought he should have definitely passed on this one.<br /><br />One of the reasons I could see for seeing this film is if you are a die-hard Sean Connery fan and simply want to see everything he's done. Save this one for dessert though.<br /><br />Well, if you by some miracle end up skipping this despite my review (or any of the other reviews on this site), then I hope you enjoy whatever you watch more than I did this. Thanks for reading.
Positive	"Saw it at UCSB's reel loud festival and it deservedly won the golden reel award. I wasn't the only one, considering the audience had the same reaction to the great piece. I thought there were many other worse flicks out there, and the judges were heavily rooted within the area of film theory and other artsy crap. This was none of that but they still loved it. The cinematography and editing far better than many other shorts out there, the storytelling is more than your average student piece. Seems as though ""serious"" student films need to include one of these categories: sex, intrapersonal struggle, and eventual suicide -- Nick and Kate fortunately has all three. Please, others, be more like it!<br /><br />Oh, and it might be my outsider's opinion, but the guy from montecito sounds amazing. Does anyone else thing so?"
Negative	"Strangely, this version of OPEN YOUR EYES is more amateur and more disingenuous. Even when aided by hindsight, Crowe's screenplay is a lot loose and more shallower than Amenabar's original. The Spanish filmmaker should get credit for thinking of the story first, and there's no doubt that Crowe has puked on it -- if just slightly. Notice that you almost have no idea what the lead did in OPEN YOUR EYES, and you know exactly nothing about the lead in VANILLA SKY. That's what i mean by more ""shallower."""
Negative	"I saw this little film at age 10/11 in 1979 when it was broadcast on CBS. I didn't know it had been in a theater at all. To rate it from a kids point of view I'd give it 1 out of 5 stars,because being a young boy at the time,it seemed a little ""girlish"".<br /><br />The climactic scene where Gazooks tickles the daylights out of everyone was a bit disturbing at the time and you don't outgrow that sort of thing. <br /><br />When I re-discovered it a Blockbuster Video in 1995,I had to revisit it! I hated it and it looked a bit ""old"". I don't know where the other reviewer on here got the idea that it wasn't on VHS.<br /><br />It's out there. Might even be on DVD by now,but I hope it is isn't. I never want my kids to see it! 2 stars on here,it's not a great kids film. (end)<br /><br />09/08/2009 : Finally burned my VHS copy!! Woo-hoo!"
Positive	I was the lone person at a 7:20 screening tonight (3 days after the movie opened), but there is some satisfaction in knowing that moviegoers missed out on a great film.<br /><br />The bloom is full in Jon Heder's rose. His great looks and geeky kid shtick are simply working. I hope to see more of Eli Wallach on screen. Diane Keaton will probably also get a big paycheck - shes deserves it because so few have acted better than her in this.<br /><br />Sitting alone in the theater tonight I came alive when Daniels was given the latitude in which to deliver his three dimensional character. He really is among our very best actors.<br /><br />In summary, Jeff Daniels's work really sells this picture.
Positive	"I watched Phat Beach on cable for a while and I enjoyed it. The fat guy is the best character, as he seems to be a nice guy. The rest of the characters are good stereotypes of young men and young black men. I like to watch these low budget movies that capture a period of time because they are almost like a documentary of the year's attitudes and fads. Phat Beach is also funny because the low-budget babes in this movie are strictly home-girls. Most low-budget movies have that ""local babe"" quality, and you can tell the babes in this movie were the local strippers and underwear models for JC Penneys lol. Some of them had so much cellulite hanging from their bikinis that it was funny to watch how the ""youngsters"" went wild over what was essentially some really over-used, high-mileage skank. There were some cuties too. That is the charm of these low-budget crappy movies. You will see a lot of doggies, and some real cuties! I checked up on some of them at IMDb and seven years later Phat Beach is their only credit. Too bad. It would be interesting if someone ever managed to do a ""Where are they now"" book on all of the cuties that have appeared in the history of movies and then were never again to return. What happened?? There are probably one or two young people in almost every movie who seem to have a lot going for them and yet years later when you see the movie again on TV you wonder ""what ever happened to X?"" Anyhow, this movie is really funny, it has really funny moments."
Positive	"When I saw this movie, circa 1979, it became the first movie that I ever walked out of after the end credits. There is nothing better than comedy that just wants to be funny, and this is it every time (and I somehow can even speak for the last 25 minutes of the movie). There was everything worth it about the skits. I enjoy racy humor where appropriate, these skits were pointfully vulgar. What was even more wonderful was that this movie was advertised as ""Robin William's first movie"", promoting his new found fame in the ""Mork and Mindy"" television series. And his role turned out to be just what you'd expect even though at times you cannot even notice him on-screen."
Negative	If you like Sci-Fi, Monsters, and Ancient Legends, then you will hate this movie!! <br /><br />The Special Effects are by far the worst I have seen since Juarassic Park hit the big screen years ago. The acting is a little less than desirable, and the story line and effects did not adequately compensated for it.<br /><br />I wish now I had seen this at the movies on our 42 inch big screen TV instead of a theater screen, because I could save $10.<br /><br />If you like non-stop action, awesome visuals, and taste for myth and lore....you have to avoid this movie!!
Positive	First off, the lead, Brad Dourif is a STAR. If you're trying to take this movie jokingly, then, I guarantee he's going to ruin it for you (in a good way). He's fun to watch. As with another reviewer, I loved the scene where Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif are declaring their love for each other - in between dodging the jets of flame shooting out of his arm in the car. Another great campy scene was watching John Landis as a snotty radio show producer getting toasted and flailing around the room. In fact, I found the last 15 minutes of the movie to be a non-stop laugh-riot - I'm sure Tobe Hooper meant it to be that way.
Negative	This creepy animated short features two comic icons - Betty Boop and Henry.<br /><br />Henry is the bald, slightly portly boy from the comics who never speaks.<br /><br />Well here he apparently does speak!<br /><br />He wants to get a puppy from Betty Boop's pet store, and when he is left to mind the store - some poorly scripted hijinks ensue.<br /><br />Betty sings a song about pets, Henry gets in a battle with birds and a monkey, yet nothing works out in the end.
Negative	After tracking it down for half a year, I finally found a copy but it was so disappointing.<br /><br />So disappointing because I'm one of those die hard SMAP fans who need to see all their works and I finally got to see the so called hot film of Goro. But I couldn't believe Goro was forced to make a movie as such. In his respectable self now, I'm sure he cringes that he made this movie. Nevertheless, they probably found the perfect person for looking embarrassed, ill at ease and half depressed most of the time.<br /><br />Man, I still can't believe he made this movie...I had to cover my eyes at many parts not believing he really made such a movie....ughhhhhh....<br /><br />And I'm sad to have watched it. Dear goodness he has grown up....
Positive	"If this is the first of the ""Nemesis"" films that you have seen, then I strongly urge you to proceed. The sequels to ""Nebula"" prove to be much better...easy to believe considering this entry is top-of-the-barrel. This movie doesn't have to try, it's naturally worth your time, folks. Watch after you take a nap."
Negative	This movie is really not all that good. And again, this movie genre is right down my alley. Yes, the sets are cheap, but they really did underperform with what they had. <br /><br />If you like cheap, futuristic, post-apocalyptic B movies, then you'll shame this one!! I sure did!<br /><br />
Negative	"""Enter the Fat Dragon"" is one of the soulless martial art movies I had the misfortune to see. Sammo Hung portrays a Chinese farm boy that comes to visit a city friend. Just like Tang Lung of ""Way of the Dragon."" Wherever Sammo goes, trouble starts, therefore he has to rely on his martial art skills to solve the differences. For some reason, Sammo's character learns martial arts by imitating and mimicking his idol, Bruce Lee. He even strokes his nose with his thumb exactly the way Bruce Lee does and also releases his screeching yell. He also uses nunchucks in a scene. It was like watching a fat Bruce Lee. There's a prosaic showdown near the end of the movie which consists of foreign fighters. Sammo has to encounter each opponent one by one. Sort of like ""The Game of Death"" but worse, where each fighter possesses a different martial art discipline from one another.<br /><br />This is one of the films I really lamented watching and also the very first Sammo Hung movies I've seen. Rotten fight scenes and a lot of failed attempts at laughs. A rare egregious Sammo Hung film I would never recommend for all you martial art fans out there. 2.5/10!"
Negative	More hate than love feeling for this film also. Saw it when it was first shown i8n Germany in a small independent cinema in Frankfurt. It was really crowded and it was a very ambitious atmosphere to. The erotic of the movie hit the spectators and the discussion with Moritz Boerner the producer and director was always underlined by that. In his genre it was a very ambitious movie even especially when you think that it was an independent movie.<br /><br />It doesn't exist much copies of that film, Mortitz Boerner came from the theatre and made two or three short movies more worked for TV as well before he became a sort of therapist.<br /><br />For the people who wish to see that movie again (i'm not sure why you would), you could find it on his homepage which isn't that easy to search for but its possible.
Positive	Have I ever seen a film more shockingly appropriate? I can't think of any that equal this one, and none which manage to outdo it. The cast are all beyond stereotypes shrined with enchanting dialogue. I am proud of all of the people involved in making this. Each one wears an expression of fear generated by the plot, but by the realisation that one step wrong and this project could easily nix their career. Especially the many charms of Ms. Diaz provide more than adequate reasons to subject yourself to this. Watch, it's obviously a style of film that Americans haven't really got a grasp of. At least watch the final result if you must, and you'll see what I'm talking about, and DON'T say I didn't tell you...
Negative	this movie is the worst movie ever it has a mockery of live action It's just bad everyone should skip it and the actor are bad though the location is Rome Italy thats the best place ever the actors are bad Mary-Kate Olsen is otherwise such a great actress she plays Charlie and thats a gruesome character and Ashley Olsen play Leila and thats a nasty character to ever love Who said when in Rome love it?
Positive	What a convincing excuse for New Zealnd Movie making. I'm okay to call myself a New Zealander when this movie exists and is currently playing on New Zealand satellite TV (Aug 2006). The cast is made up of a large number of local soap stars. The ship, though in real life, is one of the inter-island ferries that travel daily between the two main islands and even has the company's logo (a dolphin) still all over the set including on the ship's funnel. The ship is supposed to be a cruise ship/ferry between the USA and Mexico. It has obvious signs of rust and old age all over the place yet is supposed to be a luxury ship on it's maiden voyage but that's fine. One of the scenes shows the snow capped peaks of New Zealand's South island in the background <3 ! Must have been a very cold time on the USA/Mexico area! The story is sturdy, the acting is strong and the new Zealand/American accents work somehow. I expect the New Zealand tax payer contributed to the production cost of this movie and that was money well spent on a real production. I know high school kids in New Zealand who could learn to make better movies with their cell phones by watching this. Fun: There is a truck in the hold with tagging on it and they stuck a Taco Company sign on the door of the truck, presumably to make it look like it was American. But some of the sign is over the top of the tagging lol - you'd think they would have noticed that in the props department before attaching it. adds to the fun. I'd love to go on but it just isn't right spoiling for you in any way.
Negative	Una giornata particolare is a film which attempts to make use of closed spaces.It is in these dull, empty spaces that the audience sees the emotional turmoil and boisterous outbursts of Ettore Scola's two leading characters.Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia Loren play two frustrated individuals who decide to come together for some brief moments of their listless lives.It is the narrative that makes us not believe that anyone would take a side with these boring characters.All men won't really feel sorry for Sophia Loren's character.All women won't cry their hearts out at Marcello Mastroianni's existential plight.Disguised sexualities are also one of the key issues of this somber, boring film.Most of the characters grapple with issues related to their own sexualities.Una giornata particolare cannot be termed as a pro gay film although it has been depicted that a homosexual chap mixes well with women.This is a film for which Italian director Ettore Scola has crafted a bad mix of fact and fiction.His idea is to show how the arrival of Hitler changed destinies of ordinary Italian folks.A word about the courageous personnage played by Marcello Mastroianni.He acts as a man who does not beg for pity, but he needs it.He happily accepts his fate and readies himself to face the worst time of his short yet meaningful life.A failed attempt at cinema !!!
Negative	The only good thing about this movie is the hard attempt performance by Daniel Day-Lewis and Hugh O'Conor as Christy Brown, guineas artist and fighter who despite of her physical condition overcame all the odds. As a person who did work with patients with cerebral palsy, I can assure you that their performance were a result of hard work. The enormous support that Christy got form his family, low-income, working class Dubliners, encouraged him to do the impossible but this picture depicted this support poorly have read the book, and the dialogs were written foolishly to not even capture Christy Brown's witty arrogant personality. I dont recommend this movie to anyone, especially to classic movie-lovers.
Negative	The synopsis for this movie does a great job at explaining what to expect. It's a very bad thriller. Poorly shot. Tough to believe it was Bill Paxton's fifth film, and most shots look EXACTLY like a storyboard version. <br /><br />There are few shots that really look good and few show some real imagination on the part of Paxton. <br /><br />It's a boring story without twists at the end, several of them, all unbelievable, all boring, and best of all, not obscured well enough to make them true twists. <br /><br />The child actors in the movie do a bad, too. I'm usually wary of movies with kids in starring roles because all too often they come off as Nickelodeon rejects, and these kids did exactly that.<br /><br />This movie is not gory. It's not very scary. And it IS very, very creepy.
Negative	"This is the kind of movie England can do in its sleep, and that's definitely not meaning it as a compliment. Because of the success of very British comedies of manners situated at the end or beginning of the Twentieth Century, most notably adaptations of E. M. Forster novels, this very Merchant-Ivory like production was received in the light it brought when it was released in 1992. It was an exceptional year for actress Miranda Richardson, having appeared as the wife of Jeremy Irons who discovers her husband has been having an affair in the worst possible way in DAMAGE, and as the IRA terrorist who eventually dons a wig and gets a nasty comeuppance in THE CRYING GAME. Here, she plays a quiet, serene type of woman in Rose Arbuthnot, one who with Josie Lawrence who plays Lottie Wilkins, embarks on a trip that is filled with ""self-discovery"". They are joined by an unlikely pair of ladies: one Caroline Dester, played by the poor Polly Walker who bears a very weak resemblance to a very vamp Louise Brooks (and that too just in the style of hair she wears), and Mrs. Fisher (Joan Plowright). This foursome will eventually merge together into becoming deep friends only because the story is so shallow and has nothing but spring and an underwhelming, dreamy sugary sweetness it almost preordains it, and this is unacceptable; it's turns out as the movie it wants to avoid being. Alfred Molina and Jim Broadbent (then relatively new to American audiences) fill out the cast as the husbands of the two main characters, and all in all, Mike Newell makes with his movie a dead soul of wood, just full of quiet moments and no wonder."
Negative	"This movie is one for the toilet. First, I have to say after seeing this once, it became one of my all-time bêtes noires. Why? Simple; Ben Coccio (writer, director)has put together a true piece of abomination. Where 99.9% of movies these days are at least entertainment, director Ben Coccio gives us fiction, gives us his fantasies, gives us an alternate version of history to know why this happened. The mainstream media spins and spins but Ben Coccio goes further and looks school shootings right in the face, yet unable to go where no other form of media has EVER gone before, promoting propaganda from the minds and hearts of two young men planning to kill their classmates. And it surely is graphic and horrifying, how couldn't it be? The gloves would come off either way, the lies and the sugar coating of our media masters is brushed aside and we are taken to a place where we can find even worse conspiracies in what happened. Its true that sometimes it isn't just a screw loose like everyone likes to think, sometimes hatred and isolation are deeper, are more human, but we are shown that these boys are us and we them. That society left them behind and the consequences are horrifying and real. Untrue<br /><br />Respect and love your fellow man but this is not the way to convey it. A lesson we all should learn, ""thank you so much"" for making this film Mr. Coccio, I hope with great anticipation that you will now end your film-making career."
Positive	"This film is the first one of Stephanie Beaton and her new production company. While it suffers from a few problems, as every low budget production does, it is a fantastic start for Ms. Beaton and her company.<br /><br />The story is new, only related to films like The Burning and Friday the 13th part 2. But, the performances are heartfelt. So many big budget movies just have the actors going through the motions, its always nice to see actors really trying to hone their craft.<br /><br />The story deals with the murder(and possible return) of a disfigured classmate. The others are sworn to secrecy, but the trauma of the event sends each person in different directions in their lifes. Ten years later, the friends are murdered one by one by a gruesome stalker known as ""The Bagman"". Who will survive? You have to watch.<br /><br />If you are Roger Ebert or any number of arrogant critics, you probably shouldn't bother. But if your taste run more towards Joe Bob Briggs and you want to see a group of people honing their craft, then check out ""The Bagman"". Highly recommended."
Positive	Student Seduction finds Saved By The Bell Alumni Elizabeth Berkley on the other side of the desk and attracting the attention of young and hunky Corey Sevier. Speaking for myself I can truthfully say that no teachers save one ever did anything for me hormonally back when I was a student. That was a Ms. Diaz who was a music teacher in Junior High School. Even as a young gay kid, I could see what she was doing to the rest of the class. She was the only teacher I had who in any way could have been played by Elizabeth Berkley.<br /><br />Corey being the hotty he is, is also used to having his own way with women whether they agree or not. The fact that he comes from rich parents reinforces that belief. He's flunking chemistry which is what Berkley teaches and to keep his GPA up she agrees to tutor, but believe no more. <br /><br />So when he attempts a rape and gets no for an answer it's damaging to his ego. When Berkley goes out of channels and reports the crime to the police, the cops who are keeping in mind the cases of Pamela Smart and Mary Kay LeTourneau just don't believe here. Sevier's parents have the wherewithal to get a good publicity spin on this for their boy.<br /><br />Student Seduction which is a misnomer of a title if there ever was one is trash all the way. After the beating that Berkley took for Showgirls this TV film was a GREAT upward career move.
Negative	"This would've been a sure classic had they chosen ALMOST ANYBODY ELSE for John Abraham. This guy is an awful actor. Be it comedy, drama, tear-jerkers etc. He stinks. It seemed like at some point Priyadarshan realized this too, and pretty much had him jumping around like a monkey in order to make his solo-scenes a bit funny.<br /><br />He's the one of the so many noticeable drawback(there are a couple more annoying tid-bits) of an ABSOLUTELY ridiculous movie. Offensive comedy to come along in Bollywood since Hungama, IMO. Like Hungama, it's a pressured comedy carried on the shoulders of an average screenplay and of course,Akshay Kumar. This is probably his biggest ventilator performance to date. He better be a shoe-in for what no comedian should ever be at every award function. AK's never been good at comedy, and he takes it to a different level here. The body language, the facial expressions and just the way he delivers every line. It's a creepy performance. The packed theater was going nuts for pretty much the entire length of the movie and I don't think I've ever seen such an atmosphere for a Bollywood movie here in USA.<br /><br />Garam Masala doesn't have one ""lead"" heroine. It stars 3 incredibly HOT+Beautiful girls who I thought did a fairly good job. Pretty sure they are all making their debuts. Paresh Rawal is fine as usual, although his routine wears itself out after a while. Rajpal Yadav is his typical annoying self(sick of his over-the-top act in every movie). Rimi Sen has nothing to do.<br /><br />Overall, definitely worth a fenko. I'd say it's only slightly FUNNIER than the lame No Entry, and that's saying a lot. Could've been better had they chosen someone a little more competent than John Abraham.<br /><br />3/10"
Negative	Im not usually a disser of musicals,but if i had to choose what would be my least favourite it would definitely be Oliver.This film is so unwantedly made,the characters are ineptly depicted,the costumes are way off the acting is sorry and the songs are like math,one being 'Reviewing The Situation'sung by Ron Moody who gives a subpar portrayal of Fagin.I wasn't old enough to see Oliver when it was released in the late 60s but my sisters were,so for weeks on end i had to put up with them singing the bloody songs,usually it was 'Who will buy my wonderful roses'so i already knew all of the songs before i saw the film.Its a senseless musical you definitely couldn't remake it,it stands on nothing of its own.Its not accurate to the book and i don't think it would have bombed so much if it had been.I don't think Charles Dickens would be disappointed, that word is euphemistic,as he wrote Oliver to depict the poverty in London,the orphanages,the work houses and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive,and the film destroys it all.The only reason to even watch this film is Bullseye the Old type English Bull terrier,notice his long thin legs,this was bred out of the breed many years ago,they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him,and he is exactly how an English Bull Terrier would have looked in Victorian times.Notice he has scars {which is probably makeup}on his face,Bill Sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pit.A Victorian Bull Terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit.His a beautiful dog any way,and notice he disobeys Bill Sykes after he has killed Nancy,he obviously has his standards his not the chunk head Bill Sykes thought he was.That aside, this is nowhere near a great musical to watch if you like musicals,and if you don't like musicals don't even bother,there's nothing for anyone in this film.
Negative	"Raggedy Ann & Andy is the first movie I ever saw in the theaters. My dad took my sister and I, and the funny thing is - when we got home, dad asked us ""what do you want to do now?"" and we said we never want to watch Raggedy Ann & Andy again! lol, and my dad forcibly took us back to the theatre to watch it again -- at least that's how I remember it. I was five years old at the time.<br /><br />This movie was pretty scary for a five year old. The scene with the giant ocean of sweets, and the hypnotic camel scene.. i don't remember a lot from this film, naturally, the beginning was horrifying, and a few scenes -- I wish I could erase the memory, and will likely remember it now.<br /><br />I remember I disliked Raggedy Ann & Andy."
Positive	Quite one of the best films I have ever seen. Wonderful acting, fulfilling action (it's clear that the cars are blazing fast), oscar-worthy script, genuinely satisfying ending and good direction make a master of a movie. We know Judge Reinhold is a fine actor, and he should be proud of this beauty. There is no low tension within the car and, when the characters stumble upon moments of hope, they are relieved for all the reason, even 'high five-ing' when they see the bridge lowered!<br /><br />Also, the chain of events that lead these people to share the same car provides credibility. Yes based on true events, right? And since that's the case, truth is evidently stranger than fiction! Fortunate then, that it was portrayed in such an excellent manner.
Negative	"Few movies can be viewed almost 60 years later, and remain as terrible as this one. Technological advances have completely dated this love story. Special effects used are laughable for a 1946 movie. The acting is fake. David Niven, Kim Hunter and especially Roger Livesey do a mediocre job. The use of Black and White / Color detracts from the movie. It hasn't been seen on television for 20 years so few people are even aware of its existence. Than god. It is my least favorite movie of all time. Waiting and hoping for the DVD to never release for this movie for so many years is, in itself, ""A Matter of Life and Death""."
Positive	Hi folks<br /><br />Remember that movie. John C. should be proud that he appears as executive producer in the credits. bon jovi has never been but will now be an actor and the FX are a piece of art.<br /><br />The first vampires was good ... but it was not the only vampires. This thing here not just wears the same name it delivers on it.<br /><br />Just a beautiful way to spend time thinks ...<br /><br />JAKE Scorpio
Positive	"hg is normally exploitive, and it's never really bothered me--i loved ""bloodfeast 2"", and i really like pseudo sciences or playing on heuristics. the whole movie is based on a man with esp caused by an electrical accident and a witch. i'm definitely not opposed to witches, and i liked ""carrie"" (the novel and the movie) and this one didn't bother me either. i think my fondness is because of the main character developing esp from an electric line. also the university professor wasting his time studying esp cases haha. i wasn't alive in the 60s to know first hand whether or not esp was a common fallacy then, but i assume that any theory of such nature could not be discredited that easily. what did slightly bother me was the way the police were describing schizophrenics as ruthless, unpredictable villains who can seem like normal people 99% of the time and then just snap. nothing could be further from the truth. i detest such concepts because they add to public idiocy. many people still think that schizophrenia is dissociative identity disorder. whoever wrote this script maybe didn't know much about psychology.<br /><br />that aside there were a lot of really good concepts to the movie. i liked the way the witch used men; it was a nice change. i liked how she could make herself attractive, but didn't when she was around her forced lovers. i found it interesting how her second lover also burned his face. had the script been touched up for a few weeks before production and not focused solely on making its audience interested, this may have been an even better movie."
Negative	This was the first movie that Joan Crawford and Clark Gable made together and they would go on to make several more. Crawford stars a young rich girl who's father is wiped out in the stock market crash and there is nothing left for her and her brother. They have never worked before and the brother, William Bakewell, gets a job with Gable, who is a gangster and Bakewell thinks it will be an easy job but gets in over his head pretty quick. Crawford becomes a reporter at a newspaper but wants to work on the big stories but is given worthless stuff to work on. Their is a massacre in which several of Gable's men are killed and Crawford was a witness to the whole thing. It's a terrible movie and one of their worst.
Negative	Another comment about this film made it sound lousy. Talking pictures were so new - I think the script and acting were bad. Davis was so young and fresh. She had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect. Yet it is embarrassing to see her this way - still learning the craft.<br /><br />So many clichés came from this film and it seems, this film blazed some trails for the next 70 years. My vote is not to see it and remember how young this type of film was. If you insist to watch it you maybe shocked at how troubled the characters were in this picture, for being 1934 and how we view the early part of last century as uptight.. I love the youth, but wouldn't recommend it and hope you make up your own mind about it so the others negative and one note comments would prove you right.
Positive	"The form of the film is that of a suspense shocker. There are surprises, twists and turns, reverses and excitements. This is truly an ""edge-of-the-seat"" film. It excels, and disappoints never.<br /><br />The villain of the piece is believeable; his character holds so well together. I refuse to ""spoil"" the film, but will only say that the character we meet at the beginning is exactly whom we see at the end.<br /><br />The second major excitement of the film is that--finally, it becomes more that a bloody slasher film. There is so many qualitative differences between this and one of the bad ""Friday the 13th"" films. Not that every film need always be totally new, this film does drip gore on occasion.<br /><br />The film features the magnificent Sean Connery, and he measures up to his usual standard, and often just seems to be taking over the film."
Positive	I normally do not take the time to make comments that few people will read, about movies few might see. However, in this case, I feel I must sing praises for all those who might consider not spending time on it. I just finished watching it only five minutes ago. This is, quite simply, one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen in my life. The acting is magnificent, a plot is deeper than the ocean, and production values seem exotic to say the least. I know that most of low budget movie are bad, but not this one. There is only thing that could have drowned this movie for any horror fan's purposes--no on-screen gore and slashing! The grand total of three times that this occurs is off-screen. It is effective and reasonably disturbing when it happens--especially the end scene--there could probably have been a bit more of it. The movie is just the right length for it's content, nice dialogue, and consequently really a pleasure to watch. What happens? To put it all in a nutshell with room to spare, three teenage girls irresponsibly and knowingly go out driving through an isolated area where over 20 girls have previously been abducted and murdered. Their car, of course, breaks down, and they are taken to an old boring house inhabited by three crazy people--one of whom is the psychotic killer. All three are eventually murdered, one by one, off-screen, after what seems like an eternity of indulging, fast-moving brilliance. As I said, some of the things worth watching more than once are the murders. Please buy it or rent it even just for that, and don't be fooled like I was by the misleading box art and movie description. Definitely spend your money and your time.
Negative	"""Hotel du Nord "" is the only Carné movie from the 1936-1946 era which has dialogs not written by Jacques Prévert,but by Henri Jeanson.Janson was much more interested in the Jouvet/Arletty couple than in the pair of lovers,Annabella/Aumont.The latter is rather bland ,and their story recalls oddly the Edith Piaf's song ""les amants d'un jour"",except that the chanteuse's tale is a tragic one.What's boring today is this popular little world ,the canal Saint-Martin settings.<br /><br />This movie is dear to the French movies buffs for another very special reason. It is so bad. The pimp Jouvet tells his protégée Raymonde he wants a change of air(atmosphère) Because she does not understand the meaning of the world atmosphère,the whore Raymonde (wonderful Arletty)thinks it's an insult and she delivers this line,that is ,undeniably,the most famous of the whole French cinéma:<br /><br />In French :""Atmosphère?Atmosphère?Est-ce que j'ai une gueule d'atmosphère?"" Translation attempt:""Atmosphere?atmosphere?Have I got an atmosphere face? This is our French ""Nobody's perfect""."
Positive	"""Magnolia"" is a sagacious, lucid acting showcase that adds up to so much. Like ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" ""Magnolia"" is a focused series of episodes with absolute concern for coherence. The camera swoops through hallways and corridors, catching glimpses of the characters. And then there is the reason to care for these people! The common theme seems to be people who yell a lot, who can't care for others (except for John C. Reilly's and Philip Seymour Hoffman's characters), and are self-destructive humanbeings who are either falling to pieces or dying. :( I was reminded of how much I empathized with ""Shine"" because of the wonder of a father played by Armin Mueller-Stahl. There are so many attractive, appealing characters here, why would we want to spend time with someone else?<br /><br />FUrther there is nothing held back about ""Magnolia."" Paul Thomas Anderson's ideas are painted onto his canvas with care. There are two ideas in particular that shine. Both happen in the last hour of this 188-minute film. One has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of Aimee Mann's coffeehouse folk songs. Sweet, and effective since we figure out what strings them all together. The other idea I refer to cannot be revealed other than to say it is completely original and completely circumspect.<br /><br />""Magnolia"" has a lot of great acting. Particularly Tom Cruise who unleashes a performance I didn't know he had in him. And John C. Reilly plays maybe the most decent and truly good cop in recent memory. And it all adds up to greatness. When the secret unexpected event happened, a girl behind me in the theatre couldn't hold it in any more and said, ""Wow this is incredible!"" My feeling is the majority of moviegoers will agree."
Positive	"I was expecting a little something from ""K-911"", I mean it did look like a cute movie that I could get into. I always did love the dog comedy movies. But it looked like it was supposed to be Jame's movie, not Jerry Lee's. The plot was pretty interesting and the two love interests had a decent chemistry to begin with. Not to mention that James seemed to have a total sexist view in the movie but I guess the writer was also going in that direction. James just really appeased me for more than half the film. The dogs were the true stars and that's pretty beautiful that they worked as hard as the actors.<br /><br />So, I'm glad it's not just me on IMDb who agrees that this was a pretty good movie. But hopefully, James will realize he is just as talented as his brother Jim who was also the talented one, and not everyone can be their star sibling. Don't you wish Ashlee Simpson would be that good? :D <br /><br />7/10"
Negative	"I first caught the movie on its first run on HBO in (probably) 1981 and being 15 years old I thought the movie was ridiculous. I remember NOT seeing the Alfred E. Neuman depictions shown in the theatrical trailers. When MAD Magazine satired the movie and abruptly halted half way through with apologies from the ""usual gang"" for lowering themselves to satire such a piece of crap, I knew they weren't poking fun at themselves, and I'm sure they weren't, but to seriously find them ( and Ron Liebman ) so embarrassed to remove their names from any credits, I was quite surprised. Surely there are many worse movies to be associated with. Watching the movie on video now (at age 32) with the MAD references restored, I still can't get a kick out of it. And being a Ron Liebman fan (Hot Rock, Where's Poppa?) I think it's his dirtiest of performances (SAY IT AGAAAAIN)"
Negative	I saw The Big Bad Swim at the 2006 Temecula film festival, and was totally caught off guard by how much I was bored by it.<br /><br />The film centers around the lives of a group of people taking an adult swim class for various reasons. A repeated idea in its own right, the class serves as a catalyst for changes in the students' lives.<br /><br />What surprised me about the film was how fake it was. Rarely in ensemble pieces are characters treated so poorly. I laughed at the scenes in the class immensely, and the drama that took place outside was missing. Everything seemed out of place or out of character, and ultimately it left a very strong feeling of hatred, much like attending school or summer camp - where you find haters and make unwanted discoveries about yourself, and can't wait to depart.<br /><br />My main complaint was that the character of Paula had a very strong and unusual introduction, which made you want to know a little more about her than was ultimately revealed. I suppose you don't get to meet everyone in class, though...<br /><br />I found the film not well-rounded and quite boring. Avoid it if you get the opportunity.
Positive	It seems as if in Science Fiction you have this periodic idea to perform a novel phenomenon, like those that appear in long serial novels. It's where the first novel (Dune, Ender's Game) blows you away with an actionpacked revolutionary story. The sequels, moreover, takes that universe and leads you down the path to a new social and political commentary. The Matrix is finally the film equivalent. The Matrix stands tall, alone, as an interesting film with an odd twist in the middle. Seeing this cash cow just sitting there, and wanting to explore other aspects of society, the writers and directors then lead you through what has to be some of the most beautiful monologues and action sequences in SciFi. The visuals remain as stunning from the first movies, the new explorations of the characters boosts the sequel. Watch for eye candy and for deep thought.<br /><br />8 out of 10, as registered by this fine website.
Positive	"I attempted to watch this film without being able to really be emotional through it, for while it is suppose to have a ""cheerful"" message; the thing is that it is obviously produced according to the correct interpretation of scripture. An interpretation, in my opinion, will relate to a lot of people. In addition, I am a movie maniac and the acting in this film was completely laudable. Never before had I wished for a triple digit score to rate a movie. So, if you wish to be learning from those with correct authority, then by all means, get this film. This comment is also a notice to people who don't like or love scifi, because the title might push away a lot of people as well. This was an excellent film, because the basic idea had possibilities and those possibilities were made good use of. The film's one major quality is that it did make me realize that the character in the ""Time Machine"" probably should have shown a little more moral outrage at the odd behavior by those in his future."
Positive	"I can see the whole family enjoying this show. I'm not amazed how well remembered it is after all these years. It's an extremely funny show about widowed father of three living with his dead wife's brother and his stupid friend from school, and others as the seasons go on. All of the plot lines generally have a really good lesson. In the middle of each episode somebody is mad at somebody else and each episode they make up and it ends on a light joke. As for the actors, I like them too. Bob Saget was painfully true as the dad with the mom responsibilities. Dave Coulier is a many note joke 30 something year old that does cartoon voices and acts like a kid, and he's great. John Stamos was the best character but he was a little clichéd for me to enjoy him. The oldest girl, DJ, on the show was a genuinely good actress and showed perfect emotions. The middle girl Stephanie was the annoying little sister. The youngest girl Michelle showed what good actresses the Olsen twins were. The plot lines to great story lines were so realistic it's beautiful. This is a ""family"" show that replaced any bad substance with cuteness and love, and those are needed for a show about a family they did way too much. This will be remembered as my most favorite sit-com from the 80's and 90's.<br /><br />My rating: Good show. TVG 30 mins."
Positive	This movie is not poorly scripted and directed and is simply a-m-a-z-i-n-g. A beautiful novel is interpreted in this film. Many changes have been made to the storyline, presumably to streamline the timeframe. But what results is simply mind blowing. The acting overcome the script changes which gives a new highlight for their behavior. Plus, the conversion in English totally works when everyone refers to the patriarch EsTEban as ESteban. Wonderful. Please please please read the gorgeous novel, in Spanish if possible and then watch this. It will suit for you what you'd expect.
Negative	Apathetic; Crudely directed autobiography of a talented young director/producer. A love story with Rabin's assassination in the background. Probably not Worth seeing !<br /><br />
Positive	Sean, you know I think that you are absolutely the greatest actor in the world, and you are right. Comedy is your strong suit.<br /><br />It wasn't just him though. Some of the plot was just too funny. Alfred Lynch did a good job,and you gotta wonder where the lines came from from the beginning.<br /><br />Once again, Sean... I love you.
Negative	"I think this movie is shabbily done and is a fantasy. Even if you are used to watching Hollywood ""action"" movies, and use that as a standard to rate this movie, you are bound to be disappointed. This movie is so further away from real life than 95% of what Hollywood can produce, and that is what makes it rank below the average action movie. I have no experience with Swedish military whatsoever, and can therefore not point out any mistakes in the way they act. But as i have seen the ""making of"" extra I'm convinced that there has been done a lot to avoid any research into them. This is a movie i will recommend for satan to watch. High quality torture of a movie."
Positive	"I am really happy that a great director like Chuck Jones started out making some of the most incredibly cute cartoons I've ever seen. I laughed a hundred times throughout this short, and it's not even a Bugs Bunny cartoon, for Christ's sake! Bugs Bunny cartoons are always funny, these are funnier! Glad, this short doesn't turn out to be Good Night Elmer (an incredibly boring Jones short) without the addition of Bugs Bunny.<br /><br />The first warning sign of a funny cartoon is always a gag payoff. Good Night Elmer was boring because it dragged on the same two gags forever with predictable payoff. This cartoon, on the other hand, is engraved with the wonders of a enjoyable cartoon: there's just enough dialogue. The cartoon has way more than two gags up its sleeve, and most of them seem funnier than they are thanks to the immense display of humor. At one point, Elmer finishes eating dinner, and comments, ""That was weawwy awfuwwy good weg of wamb,"" possibly the most redundant dialogue I've ever heard in a cartoon (characters reading text out loud in the later-era Woody Woodpecker cartoons definitely counts in my book). Even though this cartoon is only 8 minutes long, it feels like 4 thanks to brilliant humor like this.<br /><br />Elmer's Pet Rabbit was not a fun cartoon for me, and if you've never sold your soul to Chuck Jones and are able to acknowledge that he directed a few clunkers during his career, you might enjoy it."
Negative	"The movie was actually meant to be a romantic drama based on three sisters who had desires to become a famous girl group. In their endeavors, the oldest sister meets a drug dealer and street hustler called Satin, whom Sister goes after because she believes he is the ""big time"" who will give her everything she ever thought she wanted out of life. Though he could be accused of killing her, he really kills only her spirit and will to live, after which she becomes a drug addict and ultimately dies from an overdose. The story isn't about the street life or the Italian mobster who tries to buy Stix off, then threatens him, or even about how love can overcome even the worst tragedies in life, it's a poor attempt at anything as portrayed in song and style and the character that was meant to be the life in the times for young women trying to be ""discovered"" back then."
Negative	"This would have to be one of the most serious TV sitcoms to come out of the States since the demise of ""Everybody Loves Raymond"". Warburton is always having a serious look, and in this brings the rest of the ensemble cast to malfunction. David Spade continues to strengthen my funny bone enormously with his quite plain delivery of his lines. After having raved over the British series, ""Coupling"" I can see from just where the creators of ""Rules of Engagement"" got their original idea, but this is not even a ""brickbat"" - the absolutely plain reading of dialogue and the way in which it is conveyed set this particular series completely apart horribly. But it takes more than a competent cast to bring success to a new series, particularly in the very difficult field of comedy. Having been a part of a professional TV comedy writing team for the best part of 7 years in Australia, I can appreciate particularly, the role of director and the perceptional and creative talent of the camera crew. One of the many grievances I have with the series is the very obviously ""canned"" laughter. But I guess a live audience could have laughed in the shooting of the series."
Negative	Of all the football films I have watched, this is one of the 2 worst. The other being fever pitch. But Hero is about the worst world cup ever and consequently arguably also the worst player ever to play in a world cup, Diego Maradona. This story is centered around him principally but also revolves around the other giants of the game at the time.<br /><br />The musical score is banal and the images are lazy. The narration by Michael Caine is suitably biased and dramatic (in the wrong way). This story is not about the individual games of the world cup; rather it is more about the emotions of the players and the event itself.<br /><br />Exciting games like France v Brazil( one of the most boring games of all time ) were covered in the same vein. The final Argentin v W Germany was also in the same vein. highly not recommended, esp if you're a Maradona fan.
Positive	"This film was really good whether you take it as a sci-fi movie, as a horror one or even as a comedy. The whole thing is miraculous.<br /><br />The film looks (and is) definitely exotic, the actors are masters of what acting is and the script shows clearly that it took ages to be developed for the shooting. It is obvious that the monster in the closet was added because the living head was so scary by itself -she was even on fire- and they thought they needed even more horror; they passed with flying colors here too (the make up is ahead of its times for the late 50's, rather centuries ahead).<br /><br />The film is an exception to why Director Joseph Green's career as such and also as a writer never materialized; he was usually really bad at both. This doesn't go to the actors, leading or supporting.<br /><br />""The Brain That Wouldn't Die""'s smallest achievement is its short running time."
Negative	"I was brought up on Doc Savage,and was petrified by the green death as a child but even then as now, I found it thoroughly boring.I have made countless friends and colleagues watch this film and have been most amused by the diversity of reactions,granted they mostly agree that it sucks but there you are. ""I don't know what it is about the Doc, but he always gets the girls"" has to be the worst line when you look at his sad band of men. This film is almost a spoof on all the super hero genre,and was way before it's time,it is not to be taken seriously, its worse than Austin Powers. Ron Ely is a God at bad films.It is fortunate that this film hasn't been released on DVD in the UK. I don't think it should be remade and bastardised, but, it  a remake would be better since it won't have Ron.(like the Italian job without Mini's and Michael Caine). I give it 2/10."
Negative	"I am a kung fu fan, but not a Woo fan. I have no interest in gangster movies filled with over-the-top gun-play. Now, martial arts; *that's* beautiful! But John Woo disappointed me here too by producing a highly *forced* kung fu movie, which almost has *too much* fighting, if such a thing was ever possible! This is disrespectful stuff.<br /><br />Many of the fight scenes are very cheesy (and some of them are no good), and the main characters are bore and disliked. The bad guys are a bit too unbelievably evil, and bring eyerolls as a result. You gotta see anything but the Sleeping Wizard!! He can only fight when he's asleep - it's stupid!<br /><br />Upon repeated viewings, Last Hurrah For Chivalry expectedly gets more boring and long-winded, also especially because many of the fight scenes are actually not that good. Hence, I rate it ""only"" a 2 out of 10. But it really is almost a ""3"".<br /><br />All in all one of the trashy kung fu movies, made half-heartedly in the heart of kung fu cinema's prime. All the really good kung fu movies are from the mid- to late 1970ies, with some notable exceptions from the late '60ies and early '70ies (and early '80ies, to be fair)."
Positive	This movie rocked. The acting rocked, the script rocked, and the movie overall rocked. There were two threads in the movie that were developed and the viewer had to do a bit of work to figure out what was happening (but it was worth it).<br /><br />I'm not saying that it needs to be spelled out, and you suddenly find things happening and being said as if you suddenly love it. Examples:<br /><br />The heroine's negative comments about the hero. The audience is shown everything about the guy and how he is tied into her fiance's death. The viewer has exposure to the guy's death as well.<br /><br />Also, there is a scene with a bunch of guys loading up and cocking machine guns and that is all you see before cutting back to the other scenes. A beautiful explanation about the guns and the folks with them.<br /><br />We gave it a 9 because it was almost perfect but missed a few spots. It was fun while watching it, and it gave us a bit of entertainment. ;-)
Negative	Dan Katzir has produced a film that takes us on a roller-coaster ride through a nonsensical romance set in the troubles surrounding modern Israel.<br /><br />For anyone who's ever been in love, the film brings back the horrific uncertainties, the insecurities and heartache that make love so annoying. The atmosphere of fear and isolation that came with the difficult times in Israel at that time just serve to intensify this awkward feeling. Instantly, you are drawn in to Dan's plight, and you can't fail to be deeply saddened.<br /><br />It's hard to write drama and passion like this - the contrast between the realities of Dan's desperate, snatched relationship with Iris, and the realities of a state in turmoil make this so bad its hard to replicate. If you have an ounce of passion, don't crush your soul by seeing this film.
Negative	"This is the first 1 out of 10 that I've given any movie. What made this movie so pitiful for me? Constant action - there isn't any plot parts, pretentious acting, high school writing. I only liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles made it feel to an extent like you are a part of the scene. Finally, I am served an ""action"" movie that doesn't try to follow a plot let alone please all sectors of the public (i.e. there's nothing, not even forced romance).<br /><br />I liked the first two Bourne movies, but I didn't this one.<br /><br />Warning - after watching this movie, you will be full of stupidity and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car!"
Negative	"Richard Willaims is an animation god. He was hampered in directing this film by the producer. The final product is a very uneven film with a very convoluted story, with some okay moments of animation (like Emery Hawkins' ""Greedy""). Joe Raposo's repetitive music doesn't help either. It was made in wide screen so the VHS doesn't show it in any of it's glory, let's hope for a letterboxed DVD someday. It's not worth watching even for eye popping animation."
Positive	"To be honest, I loved ""Executive Decision"" - which was obvious the template - very much, but compared to this piece of jewellery, it looks like an underwhelming piece of art.<br /><br />Not only that the people moving in the film (the term actors may be appropriate for all other actors) must teach acting classes, the guy who build the setting has obviously been on multiple aircrafts. It is sometimes ridiculous, that on a 747 only 3 flight attendance are aboard, but this is the whole iceberg. The film is full of logic besides this (e.g.: use sleeping-gas, then don't use it, then use it calculated), which pumped my rating finally to the top.<br /><br />You can have more fun in watching this than demolishing you sock drawer or in drilling a hole in your knee and fill it with milk."
Positive	"This movie starts slow, then picks up. After watching for about an hour, and seeing absolute action happen, I watched it even more eagerly. I mean, a lot happened. A lot. Hoo. Tada. This is the story. The characters are very interesting representations of the most boring people any of us know. The producers of this film should be knighted in a court of kingdom when they sell this motion picture. There is a lot to unpack. I can't imagine to tell the same story even with these pictures with captions. The script is a wonder. It's just incredible. I doubt that any script writer in the world could match it. My biggest regret is not that I missed attention for 60 minutes of my life watching ""Love In the Time of Money"", but that I missed a great opportunity to be a leader. I could have been the first to pay attention, but I waited a bit too long. Instead, I watched about 20 people pay more attention before me."
Negative	It is hard to describe Bug in words, it is one of those films that truly has to be seen to be understood. It follows a narrative that is less fluid and less interesting than anything I have seen lately in a Hollywood release. As its characters react to the chain of events in different ways, and as the events dictate different paths for the characters to follow, the audience is merely an observer to the monstrosity. The almost Proustian narrative flow of thought to thought, the very spontaneity in the script will have you falling asleep, instead of waiting anxiously to see how it all works out in the end as the directors intended. And as far as the thematic elements...there is a particular sequence in the film that goes from melancholy, to bright and beautiful, and then to tragic, all within the span of about a minute. And it falls flat.<br /><br />This movie is pure crap. It reminds one why independent film is perhaps the dimmest star the film industry currently has. Perhaps with more movies of Bug's quality, people will start to take notice.
Positive	My main comment on this movie is how Zwick was able to get such good actors to work on this movie? Impressive cast, even for the supporting characters, and all of them help this movie really. I have to admit though, Tom Hank's cameo almost ruined it, what was that about Tom? Did you lose a bet? The best cameo of the movie was Joe Isuzu though - by far a classic! The premise is good. Basinger's character, struggling with existence as a Pink Lady, is making her way toward Vegas motel by motel pitching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales. This happens as Corbett's character is on his way to Vegas to deliver an Elvis suit to his soon to be ex-wife motivated by .what else .extortion. As they both make their way, they have numerous run-ins with Elvis impersonators who on their way to an Elvis impersonating convention in Vegas. Soon, the FBI gets involved and begins to track what they think is an Elvis impersonator serial killer. Fortunately, premise means the movie was good.<br /><br />When watching this movie, imagine you are in Sundance, when story lines and continuity are really important. It is enjoyable to watch Basinger look beautiful in her Pink Lady outfit and wondering why what she is doing makes so much sense. The movie tries hard, and hits a home run. Ultimately, it is filled with ideas that could have theoretically been funny and in practice were funny.<br /><br />It isn't the best ever, but you may find you yourself loving it when watching this one.   Don't say I didn't warn you!
Negative	It's a bit messy. That's about it.<br /><br />The graphics are dodgy and glitchy, add to the fact that some of the fences are 2d, but that's forgiveable. The rest of the graphics are blurry than GoldenEye and many other N64 games. The sounds are okayish. Everything from the speaking to the SFX are just okayish.<br /><br />The camera angle is also a bit frustrating at times, but maybe it's the same for every platform game, like Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64.<br /><br />I got this game as a Christmas present in 1997, and since then, I have maybe gotten 120 stars over 10 times.
Negative	"You don't even have to see it to believe it! Directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield have done a thing really unthinkable, it is a 1 out of 10 so I can not believe that other user of this web had rate it so good, unless they were expecting to see just a normal movie, with people, love scenes, and so on. I am also convinced that this kind of documentaries are a childish way to try wake up us in order to save our beautiful planet. Finally, it has nothing to do with Al Gore's documentary-movie ""An inconvenient truth"" mainly made of brilliant monologues, painfully factual and with truths always accurate, as many scientists have pointed already. <br /><br />The best thing you can do on earth is miss Earth."
Positive	"Watching Marlen Brando on screen is like watching a master carpenter chiseling intricate details into a piece of mahogany. Brando's acting is the ONE BIG thing that makes this movie incredibly watchable. The plot is nice and laughable (comic). The other big name actors seem to be making great attempts to give the characters they portray a modicum of humanity... these characters have the humanity of us all. Everything about the technical side of this film is either genuinely brilliant or just plain nice. The director throws freeze-frame and slow-motion shots about with purpose. The incidental music is a little cartoonish but doesn't destroy any hint of dramatic effect. It's not something I really look for in a movie, but even the wardrobe was detailed. The venerable Brando worked well with the awful rags they had him decked out in. I've heard this movie called ""David Lynch-esquire"" and ""irreverently funny""... it is both. David Lynch films are borne of wicked creativity - this film was in all sense creative. And I don't confuse irreverence with stupidity."
Positive	"I knew my summary would get you. How is this movie like a Pet Rock and Disco?! Well, unless you lived through the 1970s or 80s, you probably can't understand WHY anyone would like a New Coke or own a Pet Rock (and frankly, at least in the case of Pet Rocks, I STILL don't understand it completely). They're just a couple things that seemed to make sense at the time but really baffle the younger generation. The same can be said for Kay Kyser and his band. At the time (the 1940s mostly), they were very popular and had enough clout that the studio starred them with Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi AND Peter Lorre in this film. Yet, if you didn't live at that time (it was well before my time), you wonder why anyone liked this sort of ""entertainment"". After all, Kyser and his band mates are incredibly obnoxious and their humor is very, very broad (i.e., unsophisticated and cheesy). Frankly, I loved their antics and I appreciated that there were so many musical numbers in the film. Because of these factors, the great supporting cast was given a nice seat and fans of these actors will probably be happy.<br /><br />The film involves Kyser and the band coming to a mansion where a young lady and her wacky aunt live. Once there, the bridge is washed out and strange happenings begin. Eventually, it culminates in some attempts on Sally's life and a séance (of sorts). It's all played for laughs--but it's really also a horror movie with that cast.<br /><br />Overall, it's passable entertainment at least. As a Lugosi and Karloff fan, I sure felt satisfied with watching Kyser and his knuckleheads."
Positive	"The competition for the best Warner Bros Kay Francis movie is lovely. I've only seen perhaps eight of them, but Comet over Broadway is the leader so far. The very best thing about it is that it's short. Oh, and the Orry-Kelly gowns (of course) are nice too. James Wong Howe's cinematography is too. Though Kay Francis some times looks fat-faced and far less attractive than she normally does. Minna Gombell whom I don't know otherwise is great as a semi-tough ""burlesque"" dancer (it looked more burlesque than a real burlesque). The closing shot - Kay Francis and her child (when did the child learn that Kay Francis was her mother? I think I missed that?) walking up a dirt path toward a prison painted in misty outlines on a sound stage drop is beyond magnificent. The whole film is so neat, so interesting and so carefully made that it feels garlanded by nice flowers of praise on the part of everyone who made it: Warner Bros presenting this to smart critics who know it all, in Warner Bros' accurate estimation of them, that what they're getting is pure gold."
Positive	"I earlier had no idea why they made this version of ""Persuasion"" when they already had that fine mini-series with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I supposed that they wanted to make a feature-length version, but it seems a lot had to be deleted; thankfully, what ended up on the cutting-room floor was all the dismissive wit and offensive humour, leaving a film that was a great melodrama as well as an amusing exposition of English country manners and mores.<br /><br />Also, the characters were still deep and interesting. They had lovely Anne chasing up and down the streets after Captain Wentworth just like a modern adolescent (and if you happen to be a modern adolescent reading this, let me tell you: running after a male like a female in heat is PRETTY cool). That is something a well-bred woman of the Napoleonic era would for sure have done, and definitely this level-headed heroine.<br /><br />Some have said they found this antic laughable; my reaction was not laughter, but ultimate laughter. The very idea of such a amplification of an Austen work is beyond praising.<br /><br />It was lovely."
Positive	"Only one thing could have doomed this sketch. A disgusting gunfight between the happy couple, the exotic model at the delicatessen, and the old-timer from the motel who was (it would have turned out) secretly watching from the woods and had been aging rent-boy to the guys when they'd shared the rubber house. <br /><br />In the process, they could have unnecessarily blown that freezing shack to smithereens, created some snags; such as the ""whore bitch"" ode on the windscreen, or not disclose the reason why the protagonist had ""no friends,"" or his coolness under pressure from bloody tampon, incessant phone calls . . . and that crawl-space chic, the green thumb, and his attraction to the simpler life. Quite the technician with the human body, though. Ex-abortionist? Morgue attendant? Take away the heartbeat and it would have been horrid.<br /><br />It was fun watching these people move around, I guess, and Eleanora's silly Italian games were breathtaking stereotypical nice though the caretaker had been to too many yoga classes: a dick, a mind, and a pick-up truck about summed it up for him lol. I loved how they had so less luggage: Eleanora is ready to go after putting some black underwear into her nifty red suitcase and the caretaker just needs a cardboard carton there at the motel.<br /><br />Trifling matters, I may well say. I think the niggling bits just added to the right amount in this great job. Good owl-wrangling, and I really felt cold all the way through."
Positive	this is a bad movie. I saw the series on tv and the movie was much worse. One of the worst things in the movie is that Helga finally admits her deepest darkest secret to Arnold!!! that was horrific. i cherished the TV show, but that was actually funny. It's a bad movie! Doy!!!
Negative	This was an absolutely godawful series and was glad that I was only able to catch a few shows way back when it aired late night in the UK. The style of it was so different from others of its kind and the whole thing had an unnerving air of blankness dread to it. All you have to do is read all the negative comments (not a single positive that I can see) to realise what a really unoriginal series this was and how it caught noone's imagination. I now understand from reading the comments it got CANCELLED that's just so reasonable. What a bunch of 'headless overpaid suited turkeys' there were in this (or just maybe still are) running around to avoid that?
Negative	A weak, and unremarkable film. Matthau, as Einstein, was worthless. My favorite part, and the only thing that could make me go out of my way to see this again, was the cliched scene with the physicists playing badmitton, I liked the sweaters and the conversation while they waited for Robbins to retrieve the birdie.
Negative	This movie is an extremely sadistic and apathetic story about an orphanage that is in financial trouble. When the director goes on vacation, his dad agrees to step in temporarily to run things.<br /><br />This is positively the lamest work that Leslie Nielson has ever done. His idea in the film to rent out children is run-of-the-mill, and his sales techniques will definitely make you meh.<br /><br />The little girl in this movie is the only sweet and charming that I know I will never forget her. Just make sure that you don't watch any minutes of the movie! <br /><br />Such disturbing family entertainment is so common these days. If you go for hopelessly corny pictures with weird endings,go for this one! I could vomit over this over and over, and I often do! My only relief about this movie is that it is so difficult to find a copy.
Positive	Melissa's sixteenth birthday is right around the corner and she's just discovering her sexuality with boys. But it turns out that all the guys that she spends time with all wind up murdered in this nuanced '80's slasher film. It's up to the local town sheriff Dan Burke (Bo Hopkins, The Wild Bunch) and his badass mystery-loving goody two-shoes daughter, Marci (Dana Kimmell, Friday the 13th part 3), to get to the bottom of these killings.<br /><br />This film focuses more on the mystery and melodrama aspects of the movie and less on the killings themselves and thus is able to differentiate itself from a lot of it's '80's Slasher brethren. It doesn't hurt that Alesia has a great body (I feel the need to stress the obvious with stating that the actress is over 18 and thus convey that i'm not overly perverted). Also on the upside, the movie only has a few plot points that are underdeveloped or unnecessary, but has a grating theme some that is used at the right times, and an ending that is a cliffhanger climatic. And the good outweigh the bad (by a lot). Definitely give this a rent, but I would probably buy it.<br /><br />Eye Candy: Aleisa Shirley shows her tits, bush and ass <br /><br />My Grade: B+ <br /><br />Code Red DVD Extras: An intro by star Aleisa Shirley and Director of Intruder, Scott Spiegel; Both Director's cut & theatrical version of the film; Audio conversation with star Shirley and Director Jim Sotos; interview with Shirley, Sotos & Bo Hopkins; still gallery; theatrical trailer for this film; and trailers for Nightmare, Stunt Rock, Rituals, & Balalaika Conspiracy
Positive	Hey Arnold! is a fast-moving and really gripping movie. The plot is so creative. The Paul Sorvino character (Shenk) is buying all of the decrepit, low-priced buildings in order to build a gigantic mall, shopping complex and office buildings. This plot goes back to many 1960s kids movies. It is captivating. Paul Sorvino is invigorating too, so the idea of him as the bad guy works out very well. Gramps remembers something about a historical document, and the rest of the movie is about the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal must find the document with the undercover aid of Helga, whose father is hoping to become rich thanks to Shenk's Mall. The kids must move around town on buses, and so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is not only eco friendly, but underscores how this movie is written for inspiring young kids. Hey Arnold, the TV cartoon is usually very entertaining, and it has enough humor to appeal to adults too. The TV cartoon is usually a bit faster paced maybe not more imaginative than this movie. Hey Arnold the movie, is about five times more creative, and a good way to put anyone, including kiddies to excitement. Hey Arnold was a tough one to close your eyes anytime along the way until the suspenseful and totally entrancing ending. If you want to send your kids to a totally non-offensive inspiring movie, this is it. I get the feeling that some people have that instead of trying to make a 90 minute movie, the producers started out with a 30 minute TV cartoon script and tried to expand it into 90 minutes but they did it well. This Mall Story definitely could have been covered in the TV cartoon. Hopefully Arnold will bet just as good a writer if there is ever a sequel.
Negative	"This movie is designed in a certain way... There are ""no flaws"". Not in the design of the set, the lighting, the sounds, the plot, I mean seriously?. The script is an invitation to way too complex game where the participants are on a simple mission.<br /><br />Paxton is at his best in this role, and given his last roles, that's still not much. His mannerisms, the infections used in the tones of his voice are so hard to tolerate. Each shot ""meticulously"" done. Surprises turn up one after another when the movie reaches past its lowest hour. This is not be the best picture of the year. It's not here to last."
Negative	"May 2004, Wonderland is fairly new in the UK. Worthless film of a brutal true story. If you know LA from the early 80's, you will depreciate how poorly it is captured. The use of the elements which make up its ""gritty"" cinematic style is lame, diminishing the experience and taking the viewer very far apart than actually being there. The use of a disjointed 'Pulp Fiction' style time line only allows exploration of the uncertainty concerning what really happened, while the direction and performances of the cast command punishment, especially Val Kilmer as John Holmes; a trashcan award for sure if I were handing them out."
Negative	this movie is not porn, it was not meant to be porn, and unless my uncle runs for president of the world it should never be considered porn.<br /><br />now that that issue was sorted out, i can say i thoroughly hate this film, as it's issues are still widely available. it's ugly, the acting is just okay and it raises serious (disgusting) questions.<br /><br />i can't fully understand why this film was so loved, probably this is why i plan to never visit the us. Lena is a failed pioneer of the modern riot-grrrl movement, confusion, curiosity and wit are her main attributes, she is occasionally angry, and it shows in her films
Negative	"For what it is, this is a pretty bad movie. Both Johns -Stamos (""Full House"")& Stockwell (""Christine"", ""Top Gun"") don't give strong performances. The love interest is OK, and this is more of a guy's movie than a good date movie. I find Harleys to be mediocre, and I hated seeing them paint over the ""14 coats of hand-rubbed lacquer"" with good old Army Olive Drab. There is a small history lesson here in that Harley-Davidson motorcycles played a key role in WWII. I don't know if the training was quite like this bunches! The movie lost my interest half way through because it got slow, with poor riding action sequences. I love looking at the demographics of the vote history - one 18 year-old man gave the movie a 10 (true bike lover, I guess). I'd give it the opposite, maybe a 2. I do not weigh every movie with the same scale. There are movies that were big-budget, with great actors, that you expect to be good so when they fail they fail big. (Star Wars - Episode I is my best example) I loved the first three SW movies, but I thought Episode I was weak in comparison. So it gets a lower rating from me than this movie. I expect more from George Lucas."
Positive	My Favorite part was when the climax started to roll. I wish I could give it a 1111111111111 out of 10. I really wish I can spend another Hour and thirty minutes on it. Spend your money or time on it. I really couldn't have just watched grass grow or felt better after wards.<br /><br />Nadia was really pretty and I hope the movie enhances her career. Yes she chose to be in it.<br /><br />All in all it kicked ass more than any other movie has. More than Kazaam and Glitter combined. That's saying something.<br /><br />Don't<br /><br />Do<br /><br />it!!!!
Negative	This movie is about two guys who made up a sport on the spot trying to get 2 get the hot chick. BASEketball becomes a nationwide sport. Joe Cooper (Trey Parker) is the beloved captain, but is hated when he loses the NBA to some other rival team. He meets the girl of his dreams Yasmine Bleeth, and in the end they kiss. the first time i saw this movie i fell asleep as it was so unfunny. a definite must avoid for all comedy fans. If you love south park you'll hate this! Also don't watch with kids it is bit inappropriate for little dudes. some duds give it 6 1/2 out of ten, i give it 2 out of ten. i hate coop he sucks i gotta go bye bye thanks for reading this
Positive	"i bought this DVD because it has kari in it and the mpaa ratings said ; ""Rated R for strong violence and sexuality, nudity and language"".<br /><br />which correctly, IMO, should state ; ""Rated R for strong violence, sexuality, nudity and language"".<br /><br />the word ""sexuality"" should come after a ""comma"", not an ""and"" because of the huge difference in meaning it make. i think a lot of people who have watched this movie will agree with me that the sexuality and nudity parts ALMOST perfect. my first impression when i look at the mpaa rating was that i will be watching something like ""vivid"" movie. that is why i felt full. story-wise, it was so-so, after-all who really cares about the story if the gorgeous kari was in it. i know i don't.<br /><br />of course, this is only my opinion.<br /><br />Joseph"
Positive	"Suggesting nothing less than a movie-length version of the 1970s TV hit ""Love, American Style,"" decked out with flashes of nudity, ""Superchick"" (1973) is a lighthearted film that entertains. And the lead character here, Tara B. True, really IS some kind of superchick. A stewardess (not flight attendant) who's so good-looking that even her plane's autopilot has made a pass at her (!), and with a hunky boyfriend in every port, this wingin', swingin' gal really does put the ""lay"" in ""layover."" What with her germaphobe surgeon beau in New York, her playboy with gangster problems in Miami, and her creatively challenged rock star dude in L.A., Tara sure does keep busy. And when she's not draining these guys of all their manly energies, as the viewer learns, she's liable to be taking a karate class, mile-high clubbing, fending off flashers and rapists, attending groovy pot parties AND stopping a hijacking attempt on her airplane. As I said, lighthearted fun, and surely good for any night when you're up for a good flick. Future astrologist Joyce Jillson brings some vacuous charm to her role as Tara, and the film looks handsome enough to please. Luckily, buxom '70s faves Uschi Digard and Mary Gavin (aka Candy Samples) are used here in large small roles, and get to do what they do best--show off their chesticles! The picture is laff-out-loud funny and has many thoughts in its metaphorical head, it also succeeds in being consistently amusing. Strange that the end credits should call attention to Ms. Jillson's body double, however; don't think I've ever seen THAT before!"
Negative	"""Return of the Jedi"" is often remembered for what it did wrong rather than what it did right, and that is a blessing, because the last chronological installment in the Star Wars saga is a shining example of poor storytelling. It manages to mismatch all the story lines of the previous movies in one grand mess, and does so VERY convincingly.<br /><br />Yes, there are Ewoks - cute and cuddly bears that arguably served to broaden the Star Wars demographic - and in the middle the movie tends to speed up a bit. But the final hour is arguably the worst piece of the entire saga, where Luke finally comes face to face with Darth Vader, who is unfortunately the most recognizable villain in movie history.<br /><br />Return of the Jedi did so many things wrong that people tend to overlook: it presented a horrific conclusion to the Darth Vader storyline (which went from slightly implausible in the ""Empire Strikes Back"" to even more implausible here), a boring opening at Jabba's Palace, a performance of the boring Ian McDiarmid as the Emperor, Luke failing coming into his own, the resolution of Solo and Leia's romance, and the final moments on the Endor moon.<br /><br />There are also slight annoyances. And they are the annoyances of all moviegoers who've not even time to nitpick every single scene! It's still a garbage piece of cinema that fails to serve as a great final chapter. It's just not a 'good' movie!"
Negative	"With various Bogdanoviches and Gazzaras scattered throughout cast and crew ""They all laughed"" is very much a family affair.If you add the fact that B.Gazzara and Miss A.Hepburn had a brief but passionate affair in an earlier picture it has the air of almost a private movie made for the enjoyment of the participants and that the entertainment of a wider audience merely an ancillary consideration.If this all smacks of smug ""in - joke"" self gratification you will be further disturbed to hear that Mr Bogdanovich sails right into that particular hazard and delivers a cheesy and rather too sweet ""I love N.Y."" paean that is also an altar at which we can apparently worship the ethereal beauty of the late Miss Hepburn. Make no mistake this is her picture.Mr Gazzara concedes it to her most self - effacingly in all their scenes together. The plot - a detective agency gets involved too personally in its clients' affairs - is of no importance at all,it is the performance of the two leads that dominates the movie and thats not a compliment either. Mr Bogdanovich's only ""triumph"" is in the way his camera seems to love his actors,from ""Targets"" onwards.There is a creepy glow about every one of his films that only awkward artists can coax from an inanimate piece of optical equipment.Miss Hepburn in particular looks disgusted from this love. Extra insights into his work can be obtained from reading the published collections of his essays on stars and directors,principally ""Who the hell's in it?"", recently remaindered in UK bookstores. The soundtrack to ""They all laughed"" varies from Louis Armstrong's 1947 New York Town Hall concert to Sinatra to Country to Latin,as distantly apart from the city it portrays. Mr B,s ""Golden Boy"" image was sure to tarnish,for such is the nature of the movie business,and it is equally sure one day to be burried,and when that day comes ""They all laughed"" will be recognised for the unacceptable work that it is."
Negative	"Most movies about, or set in, New Orleans, turn out to be laughably bad, and laughably inaccurate (examble: remember ""The Savage Bees""? Just the same I'll make no exception for ""Tightrope"", which got it just as wrong).<br /><br />Here's one that just inevitably get it wrong. The accents are not too bad (yes, the ""yat"" accent down here is way more Brooklynese than southern), the city of 1950 is shown the way it is/was in the director's fantasy, without the obligatory ""tourist"" shots, and they make a less than mediocre drama while trying to make everyone a ""quirky southerner"". <br /><br />One of the many films to do injustice to this city, and a bad film to boot.."
Positive	"Look, I'm sorry if half the world takes offense at this, but life is confusing enough. I don't need to watch it that way. I dig Anthony Hopkins, big time. I even watched Fracture, and I knew that would be a steaming pile of Quentin. This thing is well shot, and it's daring--more than it is artsy. Well-produced films have reasons for cuts and fast edits, and this ""is a realistic interpretation"". This thing'll make your head spin with ideas. It's the fastest moving picture ever to take you. I love AH, and I'll always give him more chances, don't skip this."
Positive	There is no question as to who is in command of the training of cadets in this film: Major Chick Davis (Pat O'Brien). O'Brien plays an officer who adheres to military discipline in the creation of a new kind of soldier from his cadets--the bombardier. But he is not so rigid as to be unfair or unfriendly. In fact, he even changes his opinion as to the value of women working in the military. He's tough when he has to be, yet at other times he is a clear mix of coach and pastor, roles he perfected in other films. His character is the foundation of the action around which everything revolves. O'Brien seems natural in the role, and plays it in fine fashion. At least two things are great in this movie: O'Brien's performance and the spectacular special effects ending.
Positive	Ah yes, the VS series, MVC2 being the pinnacle. It's been said before, this is what you get when all of the crew work their ass off on the job, thankfully all of them did. Just so you don't get me wrong, this is fun, and you never have to keep mashing buttons. As for the plot summary, WOWOWOWOWOWOW... There is a nice plot. Also beat that guy at the end and win! Yeah, who else plays this by their self anyway?
Positive	"As far as the movie goes, it's a GOOD science fiction movie. It has a lot of cool stuff in it, and quality scenes. That said, it's not the best either, and maybe some of the stuff is pretty far fetched...<br /><br />As for calling this another cube-movie is entirely reasonable. This is the very definition of building upon a great and inventive original movie... The whole feel to it can be somewhat translated into the core of the first, and the introduction of people/androids as part of the ""team"" behind the cube itself makes all the sense to me...<br /><br />I gave this a 7*** only because of the little backstabbing of the original. This one should have been kept enhanced in so many parts of the movie that there should be left no place or time to mention them all...<br /><br />Immensely watchable for those who have not seen Cube & Hypercube, also probably recommendable for fans of the series..."
Negative	"I dislike this episode quite a bit, Ruth Gordon is mediocre if not a little hammy as she always was. As has been stated, the music is very out of place, and it has a moodiness that exists in all the episodes.<br /><br />One major plot hole exists, so wide you can drive a fleet of trucks through it. It is established that the light doesn't work in the vault. Don't you think that the very intelligent Columbo or the rest of the police would have thought to check if the light bulb worked? You'd think in pretty short order they would have unscrewed the bulb and so found the note. Granted this is TV whodunit fiction, and various holes will always be found, but this seems much too glaring.<br /><br />It really doesn't make Columbo out to be the hidden genius when the light doesn't work but the ""death bed"" testimony goes on unfound, apparently for days."
Negative	The first film was an okay one, and it is nowhere as good as the wonderful animated classic which I found more poignant and endearing. This sequel is not just inferior, its really bad. Yes the slapstick is too much, the script has its weak spots and the plot is a tad uninspired. Yeah probably the dogs are very cute here, but Eric Idle is dumb as a cow. The film is a pain to look at with any cinematography and eye hurting costumes(especially Cruella's), and the music is sleepy. The acting is mostly very bad, Ioan Gruffudd is appalling and Gerard Depardieu while he has given better performances has little fun as Cruella's accomplice. But the best asset, as it was with the first film, is the amazing Glenn Close in a deliciously over-the-top performance as Cruella, even more evil than she was previously. Overall, poor. 3/10 Bethany Cox
Negative	David Duchovny plays the lead role in this film.Now a lot of people upon finding that fact out wouldn't even bother watching it.Totally fair I would say.David made his name for bringing down the x-files and is a less than decent actor. Dr Eugene Sands(Duchovny)is a drug addicted doctor struck off for malpractice.By sheer accident he becomes a private doctor for criminal millionaire Raymond Blossom.However the FBI take an interest in using Eugene to snare Blossom. Angelina Jolie is cast in the supporting role of clare-the gangsters moll.She is the only one who puts in a solid performance. Timothy Hutton playing Blossom is dreadful and immersed himself barely into his character. Duchovny himself is exactly as bad as many people would think and in the end i would rate his performance his slippery.His familiar monotonous tone and straight face is present and detracts too much from the film
Positive	"I just rented this today....heard lots of good reviews beforehand. WOW!! What a meal of steaming greatness this movie is!! Does anyone know the address of the director so I can give him five dollars more???? Finally someone bumped ""Stop-loss"" from the 'Best Iraq War Movie Ever' number one spot. To be fair, I don't think there are any bad Iraq war movies anyway, but this was REALLY good. <br /><br />I won't get into any technical details, there's a hundred reviews from other GWOT vets that detail them all. If the director happened to consult the lowliest E-nothing about technical accuracy they would've made the movie somewhat unrealistic....maybe. I guess the writer should be given the credit for this wonder of a film. He or she obviously thought of the plot for this movie not from some vivid imagination but one afflicted with the restraints of reality. Does anybody but me wonder what the point of the other movies was? Was there a message? Seriously though.....WTF????<br /><br />I'm pretty amazed at all the negative reviews really. This film is hard to watch as a vet because of all the glaring ptsd horrors but even if one could overlook that, the plot is tense, characters are deep (to say the least) and the acting is so realistic. It's ironic, I suppose, that this movie is supposed to be about Explosive Ordinance Disposal, because it's the biggest blast I've seen this year."
Positive	"I am going to keep this short.This ""adaption"" of the wonderful King book is great and more. There are many Kubrick and Nickolson fans in this site and,as a result,this movie has mysteriously find its way below the top-250.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson is good as Torrance and so is Shelley Duvall.The story,that has everything to do with the book,is a coherently strung and the characters of Jack and Wendy Torrance are completely on point.<br /><br />My advice to anyone that hasn't read the book and wants to understand the characters of this story: watch this film ....<br /><br />Oh ,and the people who are saying that Kubrick had every right to benefit the King story cause King is...a good writer should continue writing ""masterpieces"" like ""eyes wide shut""."
Positive	"Ben & Arthur COULDN'T have been less than a 10. Sam Mraovich wrote, directed, stared, and produced this movie. Sam couldn't have given his idea to a better writer, director, or left the acting to somebody who could act less. this is a good example of one person controlling the whole production. nobody had to tell him, ""Sam this is bad, really bad"".<br /><br />Jamie Brett Gabel's acting was one major good point, and he couldn'y have been any better with another director, or actors to work with. <br /><br />This movie is so good i think Sam Mraovich should be knighted in the palace with a screening of this movie (twice). the acting and direction was so good, this movie was turned into a serious oscar contendor. you just had to look, and in the right places. <br /><br />A second good point....this would make a great date movie. but after the first two minutes you should pause watching the movie and pay more attention to your date!"
Positive	Evidently, The Mutilation Man is about a guy who wanders the land performing shows of self-mutilation as a way of coping with his abusive childhood. I use the word 'evidently' because even without listening to a director Andy Copp's commentary (which I didn't have available to me) or reading up on the film prior to watching, viewers can tell what it is about.<br /><br />Gorehounds and fans of extreme movies will be lured into watching The Mutilation Man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling real-life footage, and as they're also fond of pretentious, headache-inducing, experimental art-house cinema, they'll find this one a real wonder to sit through.<br /><br />82 minutes of ugly imagery accompanied by great sound, okay music and mostly comprehensible dialogue, this mind-warming laughable drivel is the perfect way to rest one's sanity: if you've still got all your marbles, you'll switch this movie on instead say watch something rubbish instead (I watched the whole thing, and am well aware that I'm completely cheerleading!).
Positive	"Basically, a dentist husband-wife team and their 3 daughters deal with infidelity. The premise is interesting, the acting is good, and the music, although sometimes abrupt and without direction, is pretty cool.<br /><br />And so is the plot. The husband dentist drops his wife off backstage at an opera before the show (she has a minor role) and then walks back in to give her something, but sees her with another man. The rest of the movie deals with his angst about this episode, his visual hallucinations and a macho alter-ego (Denis Leary, a former patient of his) and his fear in confronting his wife lest he will have to ""do something about it."" I won't tell you the ending, but let me say that the film goes everywhere and the ending is a joy. The motivations of the characters are there: She is cheating on him because he is a dentist, decent looking, good father. Who's she doing it with? Don't expect any answers on that one actually. Good performances by Campbell Scott and Hope Davis (and Denis Leary as comic relief)are boosted by this plot which is both an American Beauty and a family film. Watch it."
Positive	"The original 1965 Japanese film ""Gamera"" http://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0059080/ was essentially an updating of the darker, less kid-oriented Gojira (Godzilla)for 1960s sensibilities. Gamera, of course, is a giant, flying, flame-throwing turtle who literally consumes energy - not quite as big as some versions of Godzilla, but generally similar in most ways. <br /><br />This version of the original film was edited and recut by the notorious Sandy Frank. And just like the Americanized version of Godzilla (""Godzilla King of the Monsters""), ""Gammera the Invincible"" gets nothing more but the spelling wrong. The American scenes are just as sagacious and pleasant as those added to the great Gojira, and add much to the story as well since there is detail follow up on them. <br /><br />The film starts off promising, there are a few scenes worth of character development, and there are enough personalities to create some tension outside of the main plot. Once Gamera appears, the film begins to ascent into a fairly experimental kaiju film.<br /><br />The acting is good enough- even the American add-ons are OK. The directing is pretty good for this period and genre, and the special effects are not bad at all for their time (all miniatures). Some of the sets and backdrops are actually very good. <br /><br />The major thing going for it here, of course, is that there is little to nothing that's not original about this film. Gamera, similarly, develops a much more unique personality in his later films - all of these are worth watching if you are a kaiju fan."
Negative	"I can't stand old Burt Reynolds movies. They're worse than every other movie combined! They might as well have stopped making movies after ""Cannonball Run 2"", but I guess how could they have known that there weren't going to be any more good ones? Man this movie's bad. Burt Reynolds has to dress up like a chicken and drive around in a racecar a lot, and the luxuriant Loni Anderson is on hand, looking extremely ugly in an eightiesly way. Burt and Loni, those weren't the days! I used to have this magazine that had Loni Anderson in it advertising for a vaccuum cleaner. I sure hated that advertisement! Plus there's this one part in the movie where the audience at the racetrack is upset at something Stroker Ace (Burty R.) is doing, and it shows one guy in the audience bending over and sticking his finger up his butt to display his disappointment! I was creeped out so hard I almost passed away into the night! If you can find this movie, burn it! And then never watch another movie again, because I tell you right now: movies will be ruined."
Positive	"A short review but...<br /><br />Watch at all costs, a thorough enjoyment of 90mins. At the end of the film I was fully knowledgeable as to what had actually happened. It's full of cameos (Stephen Fry (3mins), Jack Dee (30 secs), the ""Philadelphia"" girls) and some vaguely recognisable people but it all make so much sense now. Whether the story was already this goo or just got better in the edit I don't now but hey...<br /><br />Watch in the theatre rather than go to bed and get some rest!!!<br /><br />8 out of 10 (especially for the cameos and a Morris Minor car chase)<br /><br />"
Negative	The Ladies Man is a awkward movie. There's not much thought behind it, but what do you expect from an SNL movie? It's actually no better than most SNL movies either (i.e. Superstar or A Night At The Roxbury) Tim Meadows and Will Ferrell were both very out of touch. Chris Parnell was also horrid in his short scene (one of the funnier ones in the movie). With that, the rest of the cast is just as average and is just there to support Meadows. I've definitely seen funnier movies, and I've seen dumber ones too. Again, it's not exactly a deep movie, but it's not even good for a few laughs. It was funnier as a skit though. But still, if you're looking for a pretty funny movie, I'd recommend something else. Just don't think about it too much, or you'll hate it even more.<br /><br />Rating: 3/10
Positive	If you liked watching Mel Gibson in Million Dollar Hotel then you might enjoy watching Burt Reynolds in yet another film so good it should be widely distributed. I can only attest to the DVD version so hopefully the VHS version is similar quality wise but the movies night and dark scenes are so well done that everythings seems real. I first thought my DVD players turned my TV into HD. If you insist on missing it, I think you must have movies.
Positive	I simply could not stop watching this movie. I was captured after what I would say is my nomination for the most great attempt at sexual suggestion award: a scene in which Pia Zadora, at a picnic, stands between two boys who want her. One (the good boy) pleads for her to see the error of her ways. The other (the bad boy) simply asks if she'd like a hot dog, which he then holds out for her. At high level. I hope I'm not spoiling anything to say she turns, and takes the hot dog, with a smile.
Negative	"Ettore Scola, one of the most refined and grand directors we worldly citizens have, is not yet available on DVD... (it's summer 2001 right now....) Mysteries to goggle the mind. <br /><br />This grand mess returned to the theaters in my home-town thanks to a Sophia Loren - summer-retrospective, and to see it again on the big screen after all these years of staying away from it even while owning a video-tape ... it is a true punishment. <br /><br />To provide a critique and try to prove a point: i took my reluctant younger brother with me to see this film idk why. He never saw the film before and ""doesn't like those Italian Oldies..."" Like all the others in the theater he was pissed off by this load of pants. Only during the end-titles the theater remained completely silent because there was no one left. <br /><br />This SPECIAL DAY is no special. No wonder or refinement. And a big relief if you haven't seen it (yet)..."
Positive	I have two of many good things to say about this film: the scenery is beautiful and Peter Falk gives a good performance (considering what he had to work with in terms of dialog and direction). With that said, I found this film extremely interesting. Playing baseball couldn't have been more entertaining. It seemed much shorter than 97 minutes. Beginning with opening sequence, where everyone is talking over each other and Paul Reiser is repeating everything that's said to him on the phone, the movie is genuine. The film is filled with niceties and creativity, not to mention endless incidents of humility by Falk. Also, the director seems to have it super easy deciding whether to aim for laughs or tears. There are some sequences that are touching, and others that are all played for laughs. If schmaltzy, sentimental, and cute appeal to you, you'll love it. And if you were hoping for something with more substance, its still a good movie.
Negative	This is a pathetic political satire. No wonder why it was largely ignored in the U.S.: it ridicules our foreign policy and misrepresents what it really is.<br /><br />Another bad film from this era, Rendition, was however totally dismissed simply because it showed, accurately, that the U.S. is a war machine bent on torturing, murdering, and maiming civilians in its quest for total world domination.<br /><br />A factually incorrect plot, bad acting, some big stars (John Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei anyone?) and some scenes of hilarity but they couldn't have made this movie a hit. Thankfully, Americans don't like to hear misrepresentations about anyone, even if they are complicit in mass murder.
Negative	"If you like Jamie Foxx,(Alvin Sanders),""Date From Hell"",'01, you will hate his acting as a guy who never gets an even break in life and winds up messing around with Shrimp, (Jumbo Size) and at the same time lots of gold bars. Alvin Sanders has plenty of FBI eyes watching him and winds up getting hit by a brick in the jaw, and David Morse,(Edgar Clenteen), ""Hack"" '02 TV Series, decides to zero in on poor Alvin and use him as a so called Fish Hook to attract the criminals. There is no laughs, drama, cold blood killings and a bunch of poor film locations, and plenty of wasted cars being sent to the Junk Yard. Jamie Foxx and David Morse were horrific actors in this film and it was bad entertainment through out the entire picture."
Positive	I'm a big Porsche fan, and the car was the best star in this film.<br /><br />Haim, the drug abusing child star of the 80's is amazing as per usual, and commenting on back up from minor characters/actors would be pointless; needless to say they were all above average. It's a cool movie as a trip down memory lane into the 80's - with some weird clothes, some good shots of the Colorado backdrop and a very mind stimulating plot.<br /><br />All in all, please watch this unless you hate 80's movies, Corey Haim, or unlike myself, hate old school Porsches (this one in particular looks great) because life's too short to instead watch crappy movies.
Positive	The writers probably had experience in the army, and probably read history books, and I give this war film some credit for taking a long-needed look at the role of black soldiers in the second world war.<br /><br />The action is realistic--any episode of Combat! has similar production values, and the cast is interesting. Seeing New York Giant Rosie Greer was worth the buck I paid for this. The art direction is first rate--the men wear War uniforms, and it was pretty lousy weather by the time the U.S. Army reached Germany in 1944, which they show here, and I think the terrain closely resembled what it should have. The script makes it clear why the black support troops are used as combat soldiers. There is also a nice touch that shows some of the men carrying Springfield rifles instead of M-1s, which second rate troops probably would have probably loved.<br /><br />This basic story idea(racist southern officer commanding black troops) was well-expanded in this big budget production, and its not too late to remake it again. You have admire the creators of this film.<br /><br />I remember seeing this a while ago and thinking it was set in Italy, which would have made more sense because there were black combat troops operating there in 1944.
Negative	"This is a romantic comedy where Albert Einstein, played awfully by Walter Matthau, and his cronies play match maker to his niece (Meg Ryan) and a talented auto mechanic (Tim Robbins). The interplay among these major roles is diminished by a freeloader supporting cast of otherwise well recognized character actors. This movie should have been cute and fun ... a ""feel-gooder""! Its not. No recommendations."
Positive	"Last night I decided to watch the prequel or shall I say the so called prequel to Carlito's Way - ""Carlito's Way: Rise to Power (2005)"" which went straight to DVD...i wonder why .....it completely ...and I mean completely HITS IT OUT OF THE FIELD !!! amazing spend of time watching it and I think it would be a pure worth of time writing about it.... I now completely understand how De Palma agreed on producing this wonder-fest of a movie....including for one fact that I tip my hat to... Jay Hernandez who plays the young Brigante.... reminded me how De Niro got into the shoes of Brando to portray the young Don Corleone in Godfather II ...and the similarity De Niro was amazing and even got an Oscar for it !!! Jay Hernandez he has guts for trying to be a young Pacino.... too good for him I think he will be playing in many films in the future and by the way after I watched this spiffing movie, I sat down and watched the original Carlitos way to get the past remembrance in my head."
Negative	"The one thing about this film that bums me out is that the DVD is so expensive. It's too much for my budget at the moment, but I wouldn't purchase it anyhow, because the film is a good example of awful film noir...and I disgust at watching Richard Widmark, Jean Peters and Thelma Ritter.<br /><br />Criterion doesn't always produces great DVDs but sometimes the asking price is just a bit much. That's the case here for an 80-minute black-and-white, mono sound film that is nothing extraordinary, cinematography-wise.<br /><br />The story is the story here (as opposed to visuals, actors, sound, sets, etc.) as a pickpocket (Widmark) inadvertently winds up with espionage microfilm in his possession after pilfering Peters' purse. (say that three times!). Noone including Peters is a believable character in this movie: Widmark, the cops, the U.S. agents and the Communists and, especially Ritter as ""Moe,"" an informant. She and Widmark are the ""stars"" of this film.<br /><br />Peters does a venilla job of playing the cheap floozy but loses her credibility early on by ""falling in love"" with Widmark on the first meeting even though he's nasty to her. Only in world of film!! Too bad, because that ludicrous romance part of the story takes away from it.<br /><br />This an average film noir which means uninspiring, and not great and certainly not worth owning at a price of $25-$35. For that price, one could do a lot better in the film noir market."
Positive	Well, I was excited at first to download an animated open source movie, only to be ruined by a demo reel. The animation is excellent, the lip syncing is brilliant, and you keep watching the movie as you easily understand what's going on, only to realize something deeper every time. You feel so much emotion for the characters, only praise for the creators for investing their time. I have seen short films with half the emotion in twice the time! This could of been an even better short film, if they had just taken the time to hire a better director. I'm sure everyone over at Blender is excited to showcase their software and its rendering capabilities, but this guys-this, story telling is what makes a movie.
Positive	Drew Barrymore keeps seeing her alter-ego all over town and it's really starting to become a pain in the butt.<br /><br />After Dee rents a flat from a hack writer, her encounters with 'the other Drew' become more frequent. Writer-dude feels that it's his responsibility to snap 'the real Drew' out of her stupor, so he does what he can to help including seducing her as soon as he has some free time. Sort of interesting, and even a little scary, but Drew is sexy as usual, especially when she gives a group of rude construction workers the finger... yeah Drew, that's hot! <br /><br />Best scene just might be where Drew stabs her real-life Mom, Jaid, with a big kitchen knife... hmmm... and how was your day?
Positive	The plot is about the death of little children. Hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings. During the movie it appears that he has some troubles with his daughter. In the end the serial killer get caught. That's it, straight to the point. But before you find out who dunnit, you have to see some acting! by all of the actors. It is unbelievable how these actors are performed in this movie, including Hopper. I could go on like this but that too much of a waste of your time. Just go to watch the movie. I'm telling you.
Positive	Much like the early horror film The Boogens, the devious unseen killer is quite a surprise when it finally becomes seen. Animal House's Stephen Furst obviously had fun in the role as a product of incest, his performance is more comedic horror.<br /><br />The plot, an extremely creative one, has three sexy women(Bach, Lamm and Lois Young) unable to find a hotel for the evening, so they willingly accept to stay with a seemingly kind museum curator, exceptionally played by the deceased Sydney Lassick. If you have ever seen any horror film, you know that lovable IL' Sydney is a deranged psycho, so one knows what will happen to the lovely ladies.<br /><br />The three women are all very attractive, especially Barbara Bach, but Lois Young(a Helen Hunt clone) is the only one to go nude, as Sydney watches her take a bath.
Negative	Life Pod is one of those movies that you have to just watch and try not to analyze at all. The acting is rather amateurish, at best. The special effects are obviously low budget, but not too bad. The story line is rather stock, but with an interesting twist. Computer run amok, but not exactly a computer and the running amok is very understandable when the truth is revealed. Thus the movie never blossoms and is quite unwatchable. For me, the only allure of this movie is the prominent role of Kristine DeBell. She may not be the greatest actress in the world, but having been a former playmate of the month, she is cute enough. In all Life Pod is much worse than other low-budget Sci-Fi movies of the 1980s and much predictable.<br /><br />The White Star Lines bit is cutesy, and completely inaccurate. The last of the White Star Lines Company stock was purchased by the Cunard Lines 1947 and the last ship to sail under the White Star colors was the Britannic (not the sister of Titanic) which was sold for scrap in 1960.
Negative	"This movie surprised me. Some things were ""clicheish"" and some technological elements reminded me of the movie ""Enemy of the State"" starring Will Smith. But for the most part very dumb- not so great mix with Jamie Foxx and comedian Mike Epps and the 2 wannabe thugs Julio and Ramundo (providing some comic relief? idk). This is a movie you probably don't watch over again-even say... some Wednesday night when nothing else is on. I gave it a 2 for entertainment value."
Negative	I wouldn't be surprised if Soderbergh was pressured to avoid making pre- revolution Cuba as graphically corrupt as it was. Merely reciting a few statistics isn't going to make it with the younger crowd. Thus, even part one, which is almost entirely shot in the jungle, doesn't capture the feel of that place, even when traversing the mountainous areas of Cuba. I somewhat liked Del Toro's interpretation of Che Guevara's personality. And the actor who plays Castro, Bichir, did a low standard job, perhaps with all odds that's okay. It's clear Soderbergh doesn't look down on these people, but it's also clear he's not going to plea their case to 'yanquis' far removed from the recent past. Many of the more important historical aspects contradict what I've read. To my knowledge Castro did not court the Soviet Union until all attempts to gain acceptance from the United States were exhausted. But on other aspects he is right on, especially as to the looting by the expatriates as the island went other rebel control. The country's treasury was left empty.
Positive	It's not just the plot alone that makes this movie an instant turn-on for any audiences. It's the expert direction with an engaging script and almost perfection left and right that makes this too enjoyable to watch. I'm sorry but I do not see the 'lame' in this. Just the thrill of pointing the many perfections and hillarious one-liners. Well I'm wondering how visionary the directors think of their producing company when this movie was first introduced. Probably better than that sheriff who dove into the pickup truck full of antifreeze with a gaping bloody wound. Oops! Did I forget to mention this sheriff's the only poor actor who also can shrug off an impalement with a load of antifreeze drenching the exposed flesh? I guess he kind of forgot when he won a not-so-thrilling victory over the snowman. lol
Positive	I can count (on one hand) the number of good movies starring Joe Don Baker. This is surely one of them.<br /><br />Limited chase scenes, sharp dialogue, and no lapses in continuity made this movie a prime choice for getting the send-up on MST3K.<br /><br />And that is one of the so many ways I was able to watch this...
Positive	"i checked this one out on DVD for six dollars so I could smile as this gorgeous movie unfolds. every time that you think it cannot get any better, it inevitably does. The acting is absolutely stupendous. the plot has no holes at all. The title ""cold vengeance"" in the US DVD version is absolutely perfect for the script. The action scenes so obviously took hundreds of takes. I cannot remember having seen a better movie and I do occasionally get very good ones--well, except for unstoppable with Wesley Snipes. No, who am I kidding, while a good one, Unstoppable deserves Worst Picture awards at the Oscars when compared to this masterpiece."
Negative	"i really in slept watching this movie. like most of the people that ""watched"" it. i wasn't sure that i was getting. Whoopi Goldberg is usually a very funny comedian and she has done a lot of funny movies; i.e. sister act.<br /><br />however this was not really comedy. it is a drama with weird moments. so if your looking for a laugh riot then keep looking.<br /><br />this movie is about a black family moving up from a nice neighborhood in the city to an upper middle class neighborhood. i would say more and it think it wouldn't even spoil the movie. this movie does not deal with race relations between whites and blacks, or even about relations with in the black community. i do think that it blew its chance. if your really interested in see another movie about race relations then this movie isn't for you"
Positive	"I gave it a 8 instead of a 9 because I think ""The Wild Women of Wongo"" is better. This is an exercise in enjoyment. It's like having your teeth cleaned by a cute dental hygienist. There's a nice plot. There's sensible logic. There is certainly good acting (and the shark has some quality dialogue too). You shouldn't wonder about anything. You shouldn't know how people got where they got. It's always amazing to me how things like this are so funny. I agree with the previous writer that it is just funny bad. I know. It's about 90 minutes long and that will fill up about that much space on a DVD collection. It's like a paperweight but a special one. Or a weirdly good painting you bought at a starving artists' sale. It covers the crack in the wall beautifully."
Negative	"Absolutely obnoxious singing and dancing movie starring Frank Sinatra and gen Kelly, as well as Kathryn Grayson.<br /><br />The film won and Oscar for George E. Stoll's score, and it garnered nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor for Kelly, and Best Cinematography, as well as a Best Son nomination for ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" sung by Sinatra.<br /><br />It was a ghastly story about Kelly helping his pal Sinatra get a girl and falling in love with her himself. The otherwise lovely Grayson (The Toast of New Orleans) tortured us with her singing, and we had a lot of gruesome songs and dance routines by Kelly and Sinatra, as well as the ""artistry"" of pianist-conductor José Iturbi.<br /><br />A brutal Hollywood ""music"" (don't think it is music) from an era gone by."
Positive	"Roy Rogers and company bring ""Sintown"" back to life - it's a ghost town which may go boom if silver mining is successful. The characters are funny. Andy Devine (as ""Cookie"") slapsticks around. Jane Frazee (as Carol) loses a piece of her bitches to Mr. Rogers' sharp leer. Foy Willing and the Riders of the Purple Sage stand-in (or, is that sing-in?) for the A.W.O.L. Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers. James Finlayson (from the Laurel and Hardy films) adds to the ""slapstick"" look of ""Grand Canyon Trail"". A loose floor board delivers the winning comedy performance. Mr. Devine's mule kicks its heels. There are energetic human performances, too - and, the material is Grand. <br /><br />** Grand Canyon Trail (1948) William Witney ~ Roy Rogers, Jane Frazee, Andy Devine"
Negative	I don't know how and where do the Iranian directors get their inspiration in coming up with a plot like this. In fact, it's a very simple plot that many directors could come up with --- but may not be able to project it onto a movie the way Jafar Panahi did.<br /><br />The film is like 2 worlds revolving at the same time, apparently one connected to the other - the football match and the battle between sexes that's going on behind the walls of the stadium.<br /><br />It makes you feel like you are not even in the movie and you're one of the people who want to just run out of the theatre, and while watching the movie, as if you also would like to have a glimpse of the outside world. You will not even feel any excitement or sentiments for those female actors in the movie. It's grossing in a way that you wanted to see the ending early, you will not even want to find out the verdict, you'll be dying to exit the room rather than see what will happen to the girls.<br /><br />I liked the intermittent conversations between the smoking girl and one of the military trainee. It's like venus VS mars, it supposedly shows the difference in the thinking of men and women but the struggle of women to get equal rights and opportunity especially in a very patriarchal society like Iran is real.<br /><br />This is the second movie of Jafar Panahi that I have seen (the first being Crimson Gold) and am looking forward to watching no more.<br /><br />Am already hooked with Iranian movies but this one is a must-skip!
Negative	"Reading all of the comments Are very quiet. but can someone please tell me the name of the real artist that painted the pictures for the good times broadcast. I realize that everyone refers to j.j. as the artist in the family but, there was a real family that has the real artist, and he hasn't gotten any credit in this sight yet. So if you don't mind if someone can tell the name of the real artist I would like to tell him ""sorry your job was flushed down the sewer"". I know this Sight is definitely not for the GOOD TIMES cast but, wouldn't you agree that he has also torched the hearts of us all. I would like to know if he still paints or, if he is still alive. I would like to burn all of his work especially if displayed in my home."
Positive	Pretty crazy whodunit featuring an all black cast trying to figure out who murdered the philandering trumpet player who was just about to go to Hollywood to Make It Big. Was it his wife? His Girlfriend? His Would-Be-Girlfriend? Her Father? His Butler? The newspaper guy? Who knows? The result of this is just great, and the actors here really get me in a mood to care about finding out. Why snake venom as a weapon? I must know.  Music in this is good, but there's little of it, I wish there was more. This is worthy of your time. There aren't many better all-black casted movies out there.
Negative	"CAT SOUP has two ""Hello Kitty""-type kittens embarking on a bizarre trip through the afterlife, where anything can happen, and does. This mind-tripping Asian short uses no dialog, substituting word balloons instead. There is no way of describing this demented cartoon except to tell you to see it for yourself. And make sure no one under 10 is in the room. Dismemberment and cannibalism and cruelty and savagery and sudden death and callous disregard for others are common themes. Honest. Perhaps the most memorable image is that of an elephant composed of water that the kitties swim through and in, and also ride. But like practically everything else in this film, that silly, picaresque interlude soon comes to a horrible end. Not good, do not watch."
Negative	The movie took a new angle to Gandhi's life, which is unfortunate to see and it hides how human he was. His relationship with Harilal is something that Gandhi was troubled by and mentioned it several times as his failure as a father in his autobiography.<br /><br />My big gripe is that I thought Gandhi was surprisingly uncharismatic in the movie. It could have been better acted by the person who played Gandhi. Some of Gandhi's statements seemed too smug and it seemed as if he was intentionally portrayed in a negative light in some parts of the movie.<br /><br />The movie is not really all-rounded, but focused only narrowly on the relationship of the father and son. The rest is blurred out and only used to show the time frame and the general setting of the movie.<br /><br />Overall just an okay, but not great movie, even if you keep in mind that it is not a complete picture.
Negative	Having read Diamond's book, I was very disappointed in the series, and all in all, it is quite digressing. Reading the other comments, it is comforting to know that our warriors are hard at work, with all these attacks on 'Western Civilization' under every rug.<br /><br />Sure Diamond is more than a little preachy. Like a lot of academics, he sees his theory as the most important thing ever. He uses the phrase 'guns, germs, and steel' at seemingly every opportunity during the series. We can't seem to get it, not even after about the first 10 minutes.<br /><br />Is Diamond too simplistic (in the series) ? Sure. The part about the Spaniards in South America is particularly hysterical, condensing some very long, complicated history down to 'smallpox, swords, and horses', wrapping up the whole conquest of South America in about 15 minutes. And the point goes negated - these things did in fact contribute (and to an extent define) the reasons for the Spaniard's success against the established cultures.<br /><br />Is he preaching *against* Western Civilization in any way ? Yes. In so many words. Definitely to my ear. He says that luck played a large part in determining which cultures advanced more quickly, doesn't explicity say that luck is the only reason but its intended.<br /><br />In the end, if you're looking for something that validates your own sense of belonging, then this series is not for you. But if you are interested in distortion of the factors than influence how societies succeed or fail, this series presents a morphed interpretation of the historical evidence.
Negative	Piece of subtle art. Maybe a masterflop. Doubtlessly a load of pants for a story about the ambiguity of existence. Tale in Kafka style about impossibility of victory or surviving in a perpetual strange world. what is that? The life is, in this film, only exercise of adaptation. Too much preachy lesson about limits and original sin, about the frailty of innocence and error of his ways.<br /><br />Leopold Kessle is another Joseph K. Images of Trial and same ambiguous woman. And Europa is symbol of basic crisis who has many aspects like chimeric wars or unavailing search of truth/essence/golden age.<br /><br />Methaphor or parable, the movie is a clumsy take at the history of disappointed's evolution. War, peace, business or lie are apparently only details of gelatin-time. Hypocrisy is a mask and also present in this movie. Love- a convention? The sacrifice- only method to hope understanding a painful reality? wtf
Positive	"""Demons III: The Ogre"" is related pre-sequel are on ""The Demons"" and ""The Demons 2 are cool hip horror 1980 classic.""Demons III: The Ogre"" is very neat, entertaining, brilliant monster. I am very satisfied about the writer is ""Demons III: The Ogre"" (Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are good quality writer and funny who the intriguing William Shakespeare ghost or demon's egg from Spider's web or what Huhuhuhuhu make the girl dream). I am very glad, very very very very satisfactory movie. I Bought The special DVD box called ""Demons"" on the 3 different movies called ""Demons III: The Ogre"", ""The Other Hell"", and ""Black Demons"" don't have closed captioned and Subtitles is cost $ 14.99 from Best Buy store in the City of Downey. Why the Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are fine quality writer who make the glorious movie almost like ""Halloween III"" don't have Michael Myer monster but the people wear Halloween. I am very happy. I really love ""The Demons"" and ""The Demons 2 are better the marvellous unique ""Demons III: The Ogre"" is the best part for ""The Demons"" and ""The Demons 2"" are same demons.<br /><br />Thank you Juan Antonio De La Torre"
Positive	"This is not a boring movie, the audience might stay on its chair fascinated by this selfish character, Miles Berkowitz, both film-maker and actor here. The storyline is simple : after a divorce and ten years of a hollywoodian non-career, the author plays is quest for love in front of the camera. The first question is about how true is all that : what is written, what came by chance ? Both answers, ""yes"" or ""no"" portrays M.Berkowitz as a low average human beeing. If you look for a self-fiction about love like this one, I recommand you also read some independant comic books : Chester Brown, Joe Matt...<br /><br />Beside of this, I was quite delighted to hear so much against my country, France. I know american people usually say that the french are arrogant (that might be true then), etc., and for sure the french (and the whole world) have lots of griefs against america, but there is so much love here. I liked this movie more than just that anyhow."
Negative	"This little film has all of the elements that made the Spaghetti Western so hard to watch: ANNOYING music (by one of the few..if not the only..female composer to work in the genre, Nora Orlandi), ANNOYING action sequences (and very vicious ones for the day!), and ANNOYING scenery and sets (all in Almeria, Spain, of course). It also has a very poor story but a somewhat nice tragic romance edge to it. The actors do awful jobs--with truly bad performances from Lawrence Dobkin and Rosalba Neri (in the most vital role for a female in a Spaghetti Western..outside of Cardinale in Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West""). Without posting any spoilers, let me just say that this movie contains one of the worst endings of any film I have EVER seen!"
Positive	this was the most focused film i have ever seen as there was sophisticated plot and the actors seemed to care. 90% of the film had absolute focus on the plot, i laughed so much my ribs began to ache. the bit where the old men when to capture Robert Duvall was ludicrous. on a directorial level making a noir film gladly does not involve lots of raining sequences or pointless closeups on the main character. this is a successful attempt to create a noir thriller and engages the viewer with coherent scenes. seeing as this was based on a 'manuscript' by john Grisham i probably count this as one of his book to film adaptations as it displays at least some of the suspense and engaging storyline as films such as 'the firm' or 'the rainmaker'.
Negative	"Alright this was quite a sensitive little number but I can't help thinking I've seen it before. Reminds me of another VCA film I saw at Poitier called ""THE OTHER DAYS OF RUBY RAE"" Also had specks of ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" and ""Ratcatcher"" and Lynne Ramsay in it's execution. Which is also to say that they're not tasteful references...and that they feel very left behind and very dull for today...which makes me feel like this is not even closer to advertising (as an approach in style and story) let alone the work of an original and authentic auteur to come.<br /><br />The cinematography is just...too sad for my liking. Too coral filter (or charcoal) for my liking...too archly framed 12mm. Therefore the entire impression left me a little too distant -- beware of art that proclaims itself too readily! The french (they are a conservative bunch) seemed to buy it as did the jury however for some reason... but Cannes short film selection is notoriously conservative :| compared to it's feature selection although I wonder what's been happening in the last few years."
Positive	A comparison between this movie and 'The Last Detail' is made by some, but 'Chasers' is emotional than any stretch of Interstate highway in west Texas. And like the scenery in the mountains, there's a lot to distinguish it, given the fact that a female prisoner is being transported by two navy escorts this time around. No all in the cast come off too well; with this fleshy script that's a bit surprising. Dennis Hopper, the director, may or may not give much space to this one if he ever writes a memoir, I am not sure.
Negative	As I was watching this film on video last night, I kept getting these tingles that told me this one will sink. I've a feeling I'll be screaming over this again and again for years to come.<br /><br />It's got all the timeless incoherence you could ask for in a story/film. And even though some cultural references are known to me, a Western viewer, at the core this is a problematic tale.
Negative	I won't give anything away by describing the plot of this film other than to say that it begins with the return to Israel of a young blind woman whose closest friend and companion has just committed suicide. It unfolds like a detective story as the blind woman tries to figure out why her friend ended her life. As she pursues her investigation and the information accumulates, it leads inexorably to a devastating conclusion. The film is poorly paced and the acting, especially by Talia Sharon as Ya'ara, the blind woman, is as bad as it get. Israeli film is still working to come of age and it is not competitive with other foreign films, and luckily few have found a large audience in the U.S.
Positive	"This film's trailer interested me enough to warrant renting the DVD. And fortunately, the resulting movie is absolutely magnificent! Admittedly, this is not the greatest film ever made, or the best film this year, but it came damn close!<br /><br />The main value is the film knowing what it wants to be: comedy, adult drama, thriller, and a teen-porn! The story is interesting, as it deals with the pitfalls of mail-order brides, and the film is a well mixed smoothie. What starts out as a mildly interesting ""comedy"" (a word I use in the loosest possible terms), then goes full gear, and advances into a very dark and funny maybe a bit misogynistic thriller. Nicole Kidman knows better than us, and Ben Chaplin is wow! As are Matthieu Kassovitz and Vincent Cassel, whom I can only presume did this for the story.<br /><br />This is a likable film in pretty much every single aspect. It's funny, it's just enough sexist that you still couldn't forgive Benny Hill for everything he did, and the dramatic elements are just downright brilliant. A film to be watched, especially you absolutely have to see Kidman or Chaplin in every one of their films!"
Positive	Pyare Mohan can be safely included in the list of one of the best-ever films made by mankind. The film, one of the many handicapped-people flicks that arose after the phenomenal success of Black is provides a fun representation of the handicapped fraternity. Vivek Oberoi and Fardeen Khan are mere caricatures of handicapped people. While Black portrayed the poignancy and emotions of a handicapped woman and gave us a glimpse of her world, Pyare Mohan shows two funny monkeyish characters who have no qualms about being handicapped and bash up half of the world to protect their love interests. Anu Malik's music is fair enough. Vivek Oberoi who made a promising start with Saathiya is gladly making it big quickly in Hindi cinema. Fardeen Khan was earlier not an acceptable actor but now deserves to be honored by the film industry. Amrita Rao and Esha Deol are really pretty damsels in distress having nightmarish times in Thialnd with no one to save them - except for the afore-mentioned guys. Boman Irani, as the villainous Don Toni, is nice too. Watch the film if possible.
Positive	This movie has some beautiful sets and Albert Finney does a great job as the ruthless father. The movie wows because Jennifer Jason Leigh is jumpy as the daughter and is a perfect match for Olivia De Havilland's far more nuanced, mature rendering in The Heiress (1949). The film's feminist-leaning conclusion also supports the austere conclusion of the novel, Washington Square, whose author, Henry James, savagely parodied feminism in some of his other novels. As a fan of old Hollywood and great literature, I found this movie very enjoyable.
Positive	"I bet you Gene Simmons and Vincent Pastore negotiated in advance how many episodes they would be willing to appear in lol. Isn't it kinda obvious for Gene to switch to the ladies team and then throw himself on his sword? And Big Pussy was fun! What the gracie goodness was that ""look at me, I'm a rat!"" double episode laughter! Also all that imaginative mafia banter- HELL YEAH! The big names voted off also received money for their charity and got a nice exit. Like Wow... This is reality but its also good drama! Mark Burnett's other show, ""Survivor"" however raised questions for me when Johnny Fairplay stages his departure when he clearly had just a short time before his child is to be born.<br /><br />Yuk!"
Negative	Though not in the whole film, Andy Griffith again plays his role dreadfully in this CBS tv-movie. The plot is easy-Griffith's character dies and his last wish is that his wife and kids scatter his ashes is the place he named (Mountains Somewhere). Though it will never be seen on TV (phew) and never be released on video, if you do get the chance to watch this--IGNORE IT.
Negative	"The trailer for this movie didn't do the movie justice. And as the movie didn't know what it really wanted to get across, the first half of the movie being a light, cheap romance comedy and the second have a more serious looking, romantic ""drama"", the overall impact was much lower than I thought it would be. This movie was not even a date movie, and the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be. Kidman, being one of my favorites, of course I'm biased, but this movie proved to be a light but insensitive, if somewhat quirky movie that should have been better. One out of four stars. 9/5/02."
Negative	Sabrina the Teenage Witch was earlier one of my favorite T.V shows of life, but now? :| i used to watch back to back episodes everyday when i got home from school. So far i think i've watched every episode at least once and the whole series 3 or 4 times. Melissa Joan Hart played the perfect teenage girl/witch with normal teenager troubles that we can all relate to, not anymore. She was funny, smart, outgoing, witty, and a lot more, don't see that now. Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick both fit the part very well as Sabrina's aunts early on but now? i doubt. Zelda, the intelligent scientist, and Hilda the crazy, wacky one were probably a perfect balance in Sabrina's life before this. And i must also agree that the college years aren't nowhere as good as her high school years, and that doesn't mean they were any good. I think the ending was cruel and it was not what i hoped, it made zero sense and i had mixed feelings anyways. :/
Negative	Lauren Bacall was living through husband Humprey Bogarts illness & death when she did this film. Rock Hudson was near the top of his 1950's stardom. Dorothy Malone is however in pathetic form, yet wins the fixed Oscar for support. Robert Stack is also nominated & falls just short for his role.<br /><br />The story is so much soapy from another time making it less worthwhile than most dramas. Amazing how well drunks can drive in this film & also how quickly Stack sobers up in a couple of the films early sequences.<br /><br />You can see why the cast is so good but actually production wise this film is very bad. You can tell Bacall is distracted during this film as while her acting is fine, she looks emotionally drained in many sequences.<br /><br />The sexual references in this film are so random, that many of today's young viewers would not realize what they are. Film does a weak job telling a story & actually leaves no room for a sequel to be made at the end and none ever was made- though Written Beyond THe Wind might be a good title.
Negative	The emotional impact of this movie defies words. It is painful, torturous, punishing, and forced all rolled into two hours. This is Will Smith as he amateurs his acting ability, the full range of it. Who knew? I saw The Pursuit of Happiness and thought, this must be a fluke for the blockbuster, over-the-top actor, Smith. His performances in both movies portray whole other dimensions to Smith, a refinement of talent, a denigration of talent, the selectivity of scripts, the select whichever script, I'm not sure, but I view him differently now. Seven Pounds is one of those movies that in order to even slightly enjoy its essence you have to suspend your belief. Definitely don't watch it for the plot or even for the portrayal of fragile condition of the human heart, both literally and metaphorically. It is meant to be a story of human guilt, atonement, love, and sacrifice but couldn't be further away.
Positive	When my own child is begging me to stay through this film, I know it is good. I loved it. I wanted to reach through the screen and hug Mike Myers for his performance. This is one of the few films in my life I have watched and immediately wished to see again, if only it were immediately possible. The other films being 'Troll 2' and 'Fast and Furious', both which are nowhere near as good as this.<br /><br />I may drink myself to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to get the same joy I witnessed with this.<br /><br />To Mike Myers, I say keep doing your thing. Hell, stick with Austin or even resurrect Waynes World. It worked for Jim Carrey, and it means that Seuss is a success for all Canadians.<br /><br />
Negative	"Peter M. Cohen has a wanna-be winner satire on the mating game, twisted around and turned inside out. The critical bashing of the movie in mainstream media publications as ""offensive"" and ""raunchy"" only serves to underscore its intensity as a piece of **** and concentrated dissection of people's sexual pursuits and passions. It is in the tradition of what I call ""reality based"" satire following in the footsteps of ""In The Company of Men,"" ""Chasing Amy"", ""Your Friends and Neighbors"" and ""Two Girls and a Guy"". Cohen's dialogue is dubious and I was continually intrigued by how unrealistically he captured the real pace of today's conversations. Brian Van Holt, Zorie Barber, and Jonathan Abrahams are three distinct, unrelenting sex-obsessed predators who along with the foil of their recently married buddy (superbly played by Judah Domke) are turned upside down on their own terms by a female predator (Amanda Peet). Underneath the ""satiric"" surface lurks a ""romantic"" comedy much less satisfying than most sugar-coated studio products."
Positive	In my Lit. class we've just finished the book, Hatchet, and this movie is nothing like the book. (1) Brian never ate worms in the book. (2) He didn't know the pilot's name. (3) His mom was cheating on his father in a station wagon not in the woods where anyone could see. (4) The man the mother is cheating with doesn't have black hair, he has blonde. This is all better. <br /><br />Now for the inspirational parts of the movie: (1) A thirteen year old punches his fist through a window in one punch. <br /><br />And for the acting, the kid who played Brian was a great actor. <br /><br />I also believe that the scenery was impressive, and I highly doubt the director even read the book, for good.<br /><br />This movie is good even if you have read the book Hatchet, by Gary Paulsen, and if you haven't, then begin a complement letter to the director.
Negative	I'm gonna tip the scales here a bit and say I did not enjoy this. The cartoon is really only going to appeal to those who have very absurdist tendencies. It's definitely something that most people will not get, as is the nature of absurdism.<br /><br />the animation is horrible. The main character is foul mouthed, violent, and stupid. no redeeming qualities whatsoever. his wife shrieks and wails, apparently just barely capable of the most basic communication skills. most of these stories completely lack any kind of point.<br /><br />If non sequiters, foul language, and complete and utter randomness are your thing, you're going to love this.<br /><br />Otherwise, stay at home and do not waste your money on this  short film.
Negative	"This show has all the typical characters in a comedy: the good guy, the idiot, the pervert, the rich girl... but it's set on the 70's. That's the only difference that it has with other TV comedies. I don't know how you can like this show. Its humor is pathetic! I mean, the jokes are so direct... A typical dialog is this: ""Fez: Oh, Jackie I want to have sex with you. (audience laughs) Jackie: Fez you're a pervert. (audience laughs) Fez: Oh yes I am. (audience cheers and applauds)"" This isn't funny. I think that if it didn't have those laughs (I don't know how you call that in English, sorry) you wouldn't laugh at all. This isn't intelligent comedy, this is an insult to the public. I like most of the American comedies, but this isn't good at all. I would give it 4 out of 10. (Sorry for my poor English again.) Its a waste of time"
Negative	"This movie was the most horrendous movie I have ever seen. Being LDS I highly recommend passing this movie because you only feel even less understanding about the life of Joseph Smith. Since the movie was not made with highly acclaimed actors it is a freakish and life threatning movie that can be stoned and shouted upon by everyone. I saw this movie with my family and I can bear witness that we have all had a change of life altogether. This movie shoves people to half-baked understand how hard the life was for the prophet and how much ""tribulation"" he was faced with. After I saw this movie,there was not a single eye that didn't have an eyeroll in the entire room. Everyone was disgusted by what they saw and I have not been the same since I have seen it. I highly recommend this movie only for your enemies."
Negative	"I'm not sure under what circumstances director Visconti decided to film James Cain's novel ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (I'm not even sure if Viscounti acquired the book's rights), but the resulting movie is definitely one to miss. It is not the best version of Cain's story (I like the 1981 version best), and thanks to Visconti's lack of direction and the casting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti (a very annoying couple), it is a must avoid for noir fans. Visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to some effect. Otherwise, the film is completely imperfect. My main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good; the story moves at a very slow pace (I don't think Visconti was very good at editing his films). I think film noir works better with a short running time. Moreover, Calamai and Girotti are failed actors that keep the viewer falling asleep. I hate this film and the remakes, no one has made the definitive version of Cain's much-praised book."
Positive	"Dave is going through a divorce and his mind wanders back to his first love. ""Wanders"" is probably not the word. I should say he fixates on the past girlfriend. He recalls to the day when the relationship ended. The dream sequences only lack the hazy transitions. He fondly recalls their favorite songs and places they went. I'm not a counselor, but maybe this had something to do with the failed marriage???? Dave goes to a support group and meets up with a lady half his age (also divorced) who, instead of being ""turned off"" by his creepiness, starts to become interested in him. Did I mention how creepily good Dave is? He sometimes refers to himself in the third person. He doesn't move his arms when he walks, either. It's just great. Too make a long story short, Dave plots to hunt down Mary (the old gal friend) and kill her...err...I mean confront her. He does so. Which was really funny. He believes her to be married, yet he STILL flies half-way across the country to meet her. He stakes out her house to make sure she is alone, before he ""drops in"" on her. He has an awkward conversation with her that ends with his sharing the gospel of Christ in about 10 words or less, and flies back to the new young girlfriend. We enjoyed the movie mostly for its comedic value. I am still entertaining the wife with my Dave impressions....""I heard another Dave & Mary song!"""
Negative	"Although I like Kurt Vonnegut, I'm not particularly interested in spy stories and I didn't know this one. The only reason I watched it was Nick Nolte, who is one of my favorite actors since I saw ""Breakfast of Champions"" and ""Hotel Rwanda"". But the film brought me the same displeasure. Of course Nolte tried great, but there was too complicated a plot. There was relatively little political intrigue, and much more focus on the moral question: by reading his anti-Semitic radio commentaries with hidden secret messages to Americans, he in fact contributed to the general attitude of Germans (and, as it later turns out, Americans) towards Jews or Hitler. Which carries more weight, his service to his country or his unconscious contribution to anti-semitism? The dilemma is even more prominent as these words are never spoken, not even as narration which makes it ineffective. Howard Campbell Jr. (Nolte) is a person who learnt to hide his feelings so perfectly that he doesn't open up, not even in his memoirs. The inner conflict of such a character is almost impossible to portray - and with no help from acting or photography, this film sinks. <br /><br />There are other points to it, such as the humor or the ironical use of romantic clichés (like the song White Christmas), but those don't make it any different from average American movies either. I won't recommend it to anyone who is bored with Hollywood spy movies."
Negative	I hated this film, at first the slick graphics seemed odd with the grainy footage and I quickly fell asleep. There must have been thousands of hours of footage shot and they decided to keep most of the bad parts. If you're easily shocked by drugs or violence it is not be the film for you. There are no great characters here, (and some real tossers). Technically I disliked it a lot too, they must have used an old de-interlacing algorithm or maybe it was just that the footage looked so dark anyway but I was super annoyed by the artifacts seen in video to film transfers. (Open Water drove me nuts, mostly because there are cheap, progressive cameras available now and I see no excuse in not shelling for one if you intend to screen in the cinema). Sorry that's my own little rant. I definitely don't recommend this film if you've ever been involved with the music scene, it has some ok moments but most of it is hilariously bad, I might be accused of laughing at others misfortune during this piece.
Positive	East Palace, West Palace reminded me somewhat of The Detective, with Frank Sinatra in the role of the cop, and William Windom is the boy. It's a progressive film for China, I am sure, and it also reflects on the myths about the femininity of gay men: much is made of Chinese myths in which men take on female roles. The movie focuses on an effeminate man who wants desperately to be dominated and hurt by a macho guy. He cruises the park without fear--he hopes to be taken into the stationhouse by the officer. And that in fact happens. Then he tells the officer his entire life story while being subjected to mild torture: made to squat for a period of time, handcuffed, slapped. This is what the gay man wants, and, implicitly, the gay man is challenging the cop's self-image as a manly man. The story's about the gay man's life (which include flashbacks) are really nice, and when he starts describing old Chinese myths and dramatic works, the movie becomes educational. It calls for a cry of support for China's gays, who only want to fulfill a traditional role in Chinese society. I can't relate but I also understand very well.
Positive	"I have seen many a horror flick in my time, all of them absurdly bad, but none reach the depths of horror that this piece of trash horror brings itself to. This movie made me horrified and horrified as I watched it as I tried to wrap my head around exactly what this movie was about. Now, after I've seen it, I understand - sort of - what was going on and why, but the movie itself is a little too confusing yet enjoyable when you're watching it. Yes, there are the customary scenes of gratuitious violence, one-liners that show the mind-blowing insightfulness of its characters (""The highway belongs to me...ME!""), and enough nudity to sufficiently distract us from the ""plot"", but still you'll leave this movie feeling so horrified as your soul has been taken out of you, like a horrified puppy who isn't wanted anymore and is left in a box by the side of the road and saw a ghost. Petrified."
Positive	"SWEET SIXTEEN (1983) **/***** 86 minutes Director Jim Sotos Cast Bo Hopkins, Susan Strasberg, Aleisa Shirley, Patrick Macnee, Dana Kimmell<br /><br />Fifteen year old bad girl Melissa is new in a desert town and it isn't long before folks around her start dying off. The detective has to put together the clues with the help of his Nancy Drew good girl daughter played by Friday the 13th alumni Dana Kimmell. The local Native Americans are prime suspects since they seem to upset the prejudiced townsfolk. These events all lead up to the revealing of the killer at Melissa's sixteenth birthday party.<br /><br />This interesting fast-paced slasher is going to be memorable. It has a made for big-screen feel, with plenty score including the title character's own theme song which plays a couple times throughout. Lines like ""the killer will turn us into coleslaw."" Fit into standard eighties slasher screenplays. Marci calls Melissa a bad name then immediately they develop a friendship. Marci sees how hard it is to fit in because Melissa knows how to wear make-up. This movie would be hard-pressed to be made today with the main character being fifteen and the director inserting multiple gratuitous close-ups of her but then its not made today. The social commentary on Indians could have been developed more seriously. I am too not at all surprised at the fairly high rating this movie gets. Both Sweet Sixteen and Ed Hunt's Bloody Birthday had the potential to capitalize on that time honored tradition of the birthday party to create an intense sequence of carnage and I feel capitalized on the same. Also on the bright side releasing wonderful movies like this on DVD gives hope that others will follow."
Positive	"Go with the title ""Werewolf Woman"". The Europeans are normally well known for putting an emphasis on sex and nudity over actual scares in their horror films, but this one here is an anomaly. ""Werewolf Woman"" seems to have an intense sex scene copped off with the title character going crazy and brutally killing her partner. Fun not just the first few times, but a hundred minutes of this becomes very fiesty quickly. Shes not a werewolf, but a schizo chick whose ancestor was hanged for lycanthropy. The film has its tones set, with the first ten minutes (a flashback) being legitimate supernatural horror (I thought I was in for a trash classic after these) to a rather impressive character study of the female being repeatedly abused and tortured to a revenge thriller. At the end, the director insists this is based on a true story. Yeah, all right.<br /><br />Also, there are plenty of entertaining aspects of the production. The title werewolf woman is a looker and there are a so many nice gore effects and nude scenes. And, these don't become monotonous any soon. Also, the dubbed dialog is pretty funny in a camp fashion, especially the worlds most swinging doctor (he drinks on the job). Fortunately, the film becomes pretty horrifying fast. There's a nice plot accompanied with a lot else really. Its nice, because reading a description I felt the film had some real potential. ""Werewolf Woman"" is far appropriate, fast moving, and purposeful, especially by the standards of the exploitation genre. (6.5/10)"
Negative	I rate this 1 out of 10. Why?<br /><br />* It supposedly offers insight into something but I was barely able to understand - the surfers surf because apparently it's all they want to do? Nothing else seems to matter as much to them as surfing? Nor is it a temporary thing - it's a lifetime for these guys * Buried in the movie is apparently a history of surfing; I have never surfed, but I love surfing movies, and have seen many. Yet all of them taught me all this movie did not * The movie was decently edited. It flowed fine. The interviews were rubbish though * It's just bumpy from start to finish<br /><br />In summary, it's about as poorly crafted as a documentary as I have seen, so I have to rate in terms of that. So 1/10
Positive	John Heder was absolutely handsome in this movie. I felt like I was watching a hunk college kid act for the first time in his breakout film. Anna Farris was more than par for the course (plus she's cute). Dianne Keaton knew well. Jeff Daniels was a bonus in this movie (it was good judgement on his part as well). <br /><br />All in all, I would buy this at all costs. I'm glad I paid to see it! <br /><br />John Heder will forever be stuck in the typecast role of' the dorky kid,' and he doesn't need to change.
Positive	"I only gave this comedy horror flick a 9 because several famous porn stars of the old past appear in it. A group of tourists, supposedly on vacation in Ireland but actually in Canada, run afoul of a cannibalistic inbred mutant something or other, and the plot is brand new, sans the plots in THE HILL HAVE EYES ands WRONG TURN. There seems to be only one mutant on display, but he is super impressive. Sort of like the Oscar-winning potbellied mummy in that film from about five years ago. Some gory but silly deaths boost the flick, but the film is strictly high budget and excels beyond belief. The ending is unpredictable and has been well ""executed"". No pun intended."
Positive	This film is a great reflection for a motion picture I have EVER seen. To begin, I'd like to say the the front cover of this film is by all means all you need, if you think you are about to see a truly scary horror film with a monster clown, you are soooo in for it. In fact the killers face perfectly resembles the front cover, it's not like others where its just an image they must have found on Google and thought it looked cool. Speaking of things they could have found and thought it looked cool, there is a scene in this film where some of the gang are searching for the friend in the old woods, then suddenly the screen chops to a scene where there is a mother deer nurturing it's young in a glisten of sunlight... I mean seriously the attention to detail!!! Details are so relevant to the dark woods they are wandering through! I bought this film from a man at a market hoping it would be entertaining, if it wasn't horror then at least it would be funny right? ITS BOTH! The next day I GAVE it to my work colleague who now owes myself because of the jewel named S.I.C.K<br /><br />Bottom line is: SEE THIS FILM!!!
Negative	Jim Henson's Muppets were a favorite of mine since childhood. This film on the other hand makes me feel dizziness in my head. Okay, the Muppets are back with Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog and their friends. The premise is that they are trying to get on Broadway in a musical show in where else but New York City. You will see cameos by the then New York City Mayor Ed Koch. Anyway, the film turns 25 this year and I hope the kids of today will learn to appreciate the lightheartedness of the early Muppets Gang over this. The problem with the show is Kermit goes missing and the gang has to find him in New York City. It might be worth watching for kids but definitely not for knowledgeable adults like myself.
Positive	OK,but does that make this a good movie?well,yes, really,in my opinion.there is so much to recommend it.i found it kinda slow, influential,in fact.it's also not as predictable through and through.number one and two were somewhat predictable,but this one surpasses.i also felt this movie was quite campy at times,which i didn't really think fits this series and the character, but it was interesting! Jeff Fahey plays the main bad guy in this installment.he's a decent enough actor,but i felt he played his character over the top.i guess that fit with the tone of the movie,which would was great. plus,there were some pretty funny one liners.Arnold Vosloo returns in the title role,but is given little to work with in this movie.the character had some serious evolved scenes,as i had hoped. well.this is just my humble opinion.anyway,for me,while this movie is not the best of the year,it is pretty decent.my vote for Darkman III: 4.5/5
Positive	Will would be jumping out of his grave if he could this this terrific German-TV adaptaion of his classic play. It's obvious that a lot of money was spent on it. A stage riser, a catwalk and some randomly placed columns are the only negatives to the set. The movie was perfectly dubbed into English, although the English voice actors did occasionally mumble their lines. The whole production had an incredibly interesting dark and dreary feel to it. And Fonterbras was perfect in this movie. MST3K gave this production the treatment it justly deserved.<br /><br />To be or not to be? I recommend this movie, its in the first place on my Oscar list.
Negative	"I have had the displeasure of reading Martin Torgoff's book ""Can't Find My Way Home"" which is chock full of info on the drug culture of America, spanning the years 1945-2000. This guy doesn't knows anything!! I found him to be an poor spokesperson for this documentary. I particularly enjoyed laughing at the misplaced film clips from the hippie era, and the 70's stoner culture. The soundtrack wasn't new. Whoever compiled it definitely was out of touch with the tunes of each era. Hopefully they won't sell them as a CD set. I would highly not recommend this to anyone interested in enjoy themselves. Another thing that was missing was any mention of George Jung (played by Johnny Depp in the movie ""Blow""), who was supposedly responsible for much of the marijuana and cocaine coming into this country in the 60's-80's."
Positive	"A female country singer nicknamed ""Big T""--seriously, that's what they call her--risks her budding musical career and her life by falling into the company of a sleazy drunkard (Busey) who wants to be her manager. His mother committed suicide, his father's an alcoholic as well, and he has a violent temper. You can imagine where that leads. In the meantime, there's music aplenty, as Parton, with her fluid vocal talents, belts out song after song (at least half a dozen of them about Texas). Most reviewers consider this a mess, but I actually found it swell. If you can see it, please do. Moreover, check her out in NINE TO FIVE or STEEL MAGNOLIAS as well."
Positive	"Being a filmmaker myself, and possessing a somewhat dark and subversive sense of humour, I thought I was in for a treat when I took home ""My Wrongs..."" (not that the DVD cover gives anything away, instead opting for the ambiguous quote from controversialist director, Chris Morris, ""a short film including scenes""). I was right.<br /><br />The scene in the church is a beauty to watch (especially since we are all too familiar with Morris's warped attitude towards paedophilia from his notorious TV series, Brass Eye) and serves no purpose other than to shock (which is what I paid for). How this film is not labelled a comedy I will never understand.<br /><br />The runner's commentary sounds is a novel idea (having been a runner myself, it's often an interesting and uninhibited perspective on the filmmaking process), and this is the case here. We are treated to some public schoolboy ranting about dogs on film, before concluding that there are no really great movies starring dogs. This is all very interesting, and worth every single frame of celluloid.<br /><br />To say that this film goes everywhere would be an understatement. Its heightened style, and th e  plot, character and dialogue, leave the viewer strangely in love and fulfilled. Its message - that man should take responsibility for his actions - is both great and well illustrated.<br /><br />The film does have its moments of pseudo-Kafkaesque surrealism, but ultimately, it convinces, entertains, enlightens and just ends up being great. If you want to see a really great piece of short filmmaking, I strongly recommend ""Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life"", by Peter Capaldi."
Negative	Those French and those Germans sure have a long history of not liking each other. Note that Kamerdaschaft or Comradeship in translation takes place in 1931. Only a few years later, Hitler would siege Germany and begin his plans to take over the world, France being a casualty of his ambitions. But these are times of sereneness compared to the future. A group of miners at the border try to cross over to France to get work. They are spurned back and later at a nightclub by their French neighbors. Then a disaster happens in the mines of the French and in a poorly written scene, a troupe of German miners decide to come to the rescue. A terrible story is it not? Pabst was a failed directory of silent cinema and I am not sure if this is his first sound movie or not, but poetry is nowhere to be discovered. He isn't fussy and tries to brings a dose of realism to the ordeal. Ther is even a flashback to a WWII event that beckons the point of this story. Supposedly based on a real event, the movie does the events distastefully with directness and terseness. Smetimes, that's what a movie needs to be.
Positive	Platoon is to the Vietnam War as Rocky IV is to heavyweight championship boxing. Oliver Stone's story of the experience of a US Army platoon in Vietnam in 1968 is so good it's laudable. Since most or all of the occurrences in Platoon did occur over the 10+ year span of US military involvement in Vietnam, to portray these things happening to one small group of men in such a short time frame (weeks) gives an unlikely yet well detailed picture of the war. In Platoon, the men of the platoon see all of the following in the course of a week or two: US soldiers murdering civilians, US Soldiers raping civilians, a US Sergeant murdering another US Sergeant, a US Private murdering a US Staff Sergeant, US soldiers killed/wounded by friendly fire, 90%+ killed or wounded in the platoon. For Stone to try to pass this film off as the typical experience of a US soldier in Vietnam is not wrong its creative. Two other Vietnam War films I would recommend are We Were Soldiers (the TRUE story of arguably the worst battle for US soldiers in Vietnam) and HBO's A Bright Shining Lie.
Negative	"Cypher is a movie well worth trashing primarily because it's not the run-of-the-mill Sci-Fi flick. The poor man's artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of what's going on. The close-up camera view is how the director messes up the plot. The sci-fi aspect of the movie is no where near to the plot of the movie. The technology used in the movie isn't overly impressive, and, the director makes amateur use of the props. <br /><br />The character development is shallow. The main character, Jeremy Northam, decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage. It's up to the audience to figure out his ""enigmatic"" character and it's the ""enigma"" that makes the audience want to leave right in the very beginning."
Negative	"Disregard the plot and watch Fred Astaire doing A Foggy Day and several other dances, one a duo with a hapless Joan Fontaine. Here we see Astaire doing what are essentially ""stage"" dances in a worse form than in his films with Ginger Rogers, and before he learned how to take full advantage of the potential of film. Worst of all: the fact that we see Burns and Allen before their radio/TV husband-wife comedy career, doing the kind of dancing they must have done in vaudeville and did not have a chance to do in their Paramount college films from the 30s. (George was once a tap dance instructor). Their two numbers with Fred are low points of the film, and not worth waiting for. The first soft shoe trio is a warm-down for the ""Chin up"" carnival number, in which the three of them sing and dance through the rides and other attractions. It almost seems spontaneously awful. Fan of Fred Astaire and Burns & Allen will find it not worth bearing up under the ""plot"". I've seen this one 4 or 5 times, and find the fast forward button helpful (for the whole film)."
Negative	Forgettable, no atmosphere, and not acted by all.<br /><br />I really cannot understand what sort of people are voting this as a ten.<br /><br />This, along with Grapes of Wrath, is John Ford's worst movie. I would say that Long Voyage Home is next in line, though quite a way back.<br /><br />Rating: 2? It deserves a 1 maybe.
Negative	"This obscure de Sica delivers the ""goods"". And it is said ""the meek shall inherit the earth."" This tale of classes on the surface but really an allegory for all the homeless people that populated Europe after the great war. They are homeless but cheerful, in a societies too impoverished and selfish to care for or acknowledge them, footmats for the Italian carpetbaggers. de Sica chooses to tell it as a fairy tale, a Cinderella story. how could it even be?. I have not read the book it is based on so I cannot foresay if the deus ex machina is the construct of the writer or Vittorio. It begins with the words, ""Once upon a time..."" to exemplify the timelessness of its tale, for the story could be set anywhere and everywhere. Caricature sketches of the aristocracy that cut to the bone, whimsical nature of the homeless especially when they begin to grant their wishes and an ending right out of a Spielberg picture makes this boulange a delight for all. De Sica's most accessible picture is also one of his best. unfortunately it's not this one. Abandoning neo-realism, he always dallied between that and pure good old film-making, he creates a movie that breaks your urge to see movies and at the same time fills it with hope that humanity needs to leave this world. Gracias Vittorio para nada! Gracias! Gracias!!! Gracias!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Negative	"This movie is a third-rate. The plot is so different from the book which is a classic written by Mark Twain. The movie starts of with a scene where Hank sings a song with a bunch of kids called ""when you stub your toe on the moon"" It reminds me of Sinatra's song High Hopes, just that this is ridiculous and lacks inspiration. The Music is mediocre at best throughout and my least favorite song is sung by the King, Hank (bing Crosby) and Sir ""Saggy"" Sagamore. OVerall a lousy family movie or even a lousy Date movie. This is a movie you should skip once and forever. The princess played by Rhonda Fleming is gorgeous though. I abhor this movie!! If you liked Danny Kaye in the Court Jester then you will definitely resent this movie."
Negative	It's such a relief that because of it's title this film will be avoided by people who hate football. Bend it Like Beckham is nothing more than a cheesy sports flick. The story line is cliched and dumb while being soppy, the jokes weren't laugh out loud funny, and the characters are dragfully acted. Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley are barely okay as teenagers Jess and Jules, putting in less than reasonable performances both on and off the pitch. Anupam Kher is fine as Jess' worried father, and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, who was so amazingly evil in 'Ride with the Devil,' comes across so bad as the nice guy once again, making no use of his otherwise gorgeous Irish accent! Even if you don't like football, don't see this film. If anything it'll make you scream for help.
Negative	Another in the they don't make em like that category. This story of a family with some real skeletons in its closet qualifies as an over-the-top ridiculous film. Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are at their lowest form as the troubled Hadley siblings, and they really took the roles and ran with them in the wrong direction. Malone was nominated for worst supporting actor, the honors were eminently well-deserved. They counterbalance the somewhat okay leads. Neither Bacall nor Hudson could ever be called good actors, but they've both had better parts and played them far more convincingly than they do here. It's kind of hard for me to accept Rock Hudson playing such a red-blooded heterosexual as he does here, and that's a  general negative. That takes away from the movie's overall entertainment value, which is considerably lacking and this movie is extremely unwatchable. If you're up some night and this movie comes on I'd say changed the channel. It's well worth it.
Positive	Man, even Plan 9 From Outer Space isn't better than this movie. This flick has all the plot for an hour or so, and they managed to rightly fit it for an eternity of more than an hour. Jet Li and Corey Yuen are pretty good, specially in those exaggerated fight scenes, and stuff like The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk isn't any better than this beautiful thing that would be better watched on big screen.
Negative	"I guess if a film has no magic, I need it to at least be fluid or seamless. It can't just skip background information, go too fast in some places, too slow in others, etc. Magic in this film: the scene in the library? nah! There are so many minor flaws in Stanley & Iris, that they detract from the overall positive impact of watching people help each other in areas of life that seem the most incomprehensible, the hardest to fix. Both characters should have been smart. Yet Stanley can't understand enough to function because he can't read; he can't read because he's had too much adventure in his childhood. Iris, although well-educated, hasn't had enough adventure and so can't understand how to move past the U-turn her life took. In both their faults and strengths, the characters ""cutely"" compliment each other. It is a bit of a stretch to accept that an Iris would wind up working year after year in a factory, or that a Stanley never hid his illiteracy enough to work in construction or some other better-paying job. And while these ""mysteries"" are explained in the course of the story, their unfolding seems massively contrived. I assume no one took the time to rethink the script. Even so, it's a bad movie just imagine what De Niro, Fonda and Plimpton would have done on screen if someone had!"
Negative	"Dead To Rights is about a Police Officer named Jack Slate who finds his murdered father and goes after the man that he thinks killed him.Jack is later shot and framed for the murder of the man he suspected of killing his father.<br /><br />Several months later on the day Jack is going to be executed he escapes from prison and searches the city for the man who framed him for murder.Jack's search leads him through a trail of *beep* that doesn't end until everyone is dead.<br /><br />Through out the game Jack uses weapons from M4 Carbines to his dog Shadow to kill endless streams of people in 15 levels.The game play is basically ""kill 30 people,find switch to open door.kill 50 people,find switch to open door"" over and over until the level is done.There are mini games too like playing as a stripper to distract bouncers at a Night Club so Jack can get to another area in the club,or bomb disarming.<br /><br />Dead To Rights is also a hard game.You will be put in an area swarming with bad guys armed with Sub Machine Guns while you only have a pistol.Near the end of the game skill turns to dust and you have to rely on luck.<br /><br />Dead To Rights is as gory as it is hard.If you shoot a guy in the face with a shot gun blood will splatter on the walls,ceiling and floor.And since there are several guys in each area the walls will be painted in blood.<br /><br />I hated this game, its not fun for anyone."
Positive	I don't know where to begin. The cast is full of people who've never done anything before but a lot since. Weirdly Debralee Scott is listed on cover boxes, but does not appear in the movie at all. The writing is not bad, especially for college films. It's obviously very low budget, with one scene at the sorority house having a bit of choppy editing.<br /><br />The characters are however great for college films - timid guy, nerd, suave black guy, tough guys, guy with mustache, attractive girl, small town girl, etc. The featured teacher is also what's you'd probably not expect... middle aged heavy set guy who gets sidetracked easily.<br /><br />If you wan't to see a college flick, ram straight into this one. It's so funny, it's not bad.
Negative	There is no denying that Ealing comedies are good, but for me this film stands out as one of the worst.<br /><br />The basic premise of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London is discovered to be part of Burgundy, not the UK. We then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes, and keep out the black market traders who soon realise that being exempt from UK law, rationing does not exist. When they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the boarder we see them fight back against the system.<br /><br />They are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is right. In fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started, that's where the moral comes in. It's when they loose all the food that they think they are beaten and call for a surrender, only to have the whole of London respond to their plight by sending food, lot's of it. Thus enabling them to continue their struggle.<br /><br />This film hit's the wrong note throughout, the acting is awful, with Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford, Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren standing out. It's pitched poorly, too sentimental and the moral of the story forced down your throat. Not worth a viewing
Negative	"Who would want to go on road trip with Peter Falk? That guy's right eye has less character than most actors today. This is the kind of gross and ""touching"" movie we are all looking for as a alternate to all the nice special effects entertainers. Women are going to hate it for all the creepy romance advice for men, and men will hate it for its way-off father/son character study--one pitty little scene after another. And it has just enough of an edge to be a fakery in indie. Obviously this is a labor for Paul Reiser who obviously doesn't understand what it's like to be both a father and a son, or to have both laughter and tears as you move through life. The only fun part, though, was watching Reiser watch Falk. You could tell it was both his character coming to a new appreciation of his father and a fellow actor even though really hating Peter Falk's ""special craft."" Really gruesome. Let's hope this film is taken off the theaters around the country sometime soon so everyone can have a chance to laugh and cry with some real actors."
Positive	"This movie frequently extrapolates quantum mechanics to justify futurist ideas, capped by such inspiring statements like ""we all create our own reality"".<br /><br />Yes, folks, reality is this, what true for all of us is what we just see, not just the credulous.<br /><br />The idea that ""anything's possible"" hold water even on closer examination: if anything's possible, contrary things are thus possible and so nothing's possible but we're talking alternate universe. This leads to postmodernistic theories, which are nothing less than an attempt to elevate established truths so that all ideas, well-founded and stupid, are equal.<br /><br />To quote sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick, who put it so well, ""Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away."""
Positive	OK we all love the daisy dukes, and look at this cast! Lets start, Jessica Simpson as Daisy, there is everything country about this girl and Daisy was ditzy! Uncle Jesse was probably the closest one to resemble the original. Burt was perfectly suited for Boss HOg. That was part of the humor of Boss Hog was his size. Could thing they didn't try someone like Danny Devito!!! OK , now get this they cast Jessica Simpson did anyone take a look at her husband? He matches Luke Duke to a tee!!!!!! That would have made this film even better. Cleary these producers looked at the appearance of the old cast members. The screen t's were ever present on the dukes!! This made the movie a turn on from the beginning. I give this a HUGE thumbs up.
Positive	If you haven't seen this, it's incredible. It is pure gold. I saw this about 17 years ago, and I'm still pumped up from it.
Positive	Another brilliant third-season entry, 'Is There In Truth No Beauty?' has at least one key plot element that is very different and as Spock would say, fascinating. The main character is an alien who must be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane. It's great the episode lived up to this incredible premise. Obviously, I think, it was a nice thing to 'show' the alien, as its actual visage leads to such a daunting build-up; and then we get the Star Trek psychedelic light display used for many number of things in different episodes, usually when the ship is passing through a magnetic storm or something similar. In any event, Kollos' appearance can at least be tolerated by Mr. Spock, and then only if Spock is wearing a special visor. (For the longest time, I thought the alien's name was 'Carlos,' which I found humorous, but I digress.) Spock is required to mind-meld with Kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the Enterprise back to safety. This is accomplished, but when Spock/Kollos go back to end the mind-meld, by golly, Spock forgets his visor. Uh oh. He goes crazy but eventually recovers with the help of Kollos' assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers. This might have been a really bizarre, excellent episode and it is well directed and comes across as yet one more well executed show of the series' last season.
Positive	F*ck Me! I've seen some incredibly horrific movies in my time but this takes the prize!<br /><br />Honestly I can't express in words how splendid this film actually is. Besides the plot that is actually unconventional, the highly horrific acting, the frighteningly wonderful contexts for zombies; You know what, I could go on all day. Every little thing in this film is either smart, wonderful, gold or proudly. I express to anyone who wants to watch this movie... don't wait!<br /><br />I'm happy to say, I have this on my rack. It's there right at the god damn top of the huge pile. I couldn't ever give this unicorn making for a film away. That's how good it is.
Positive	"Christ. A sequel to one of the most cute films of all time, this though has the idea to leave out the songs (bar a reprise of the wonderful ""Tomorrow"") and does continue the tradition of being stunning and funny at the same time. This time, Annie and her friends head off to London and get caught up in Joan Collins's plot to blow up Buckingham Palace or some such shite. The movie at times has a bizarrely sycophantic attitude towards its eponymous character at odds with how irritating she is: one time the little bugger squealed ""Leapin' lizards!"" I could feel my teeth grinding themselves down into powder but it was funny nonetheless. Well photographed, solid and smooth, the movie has multiple memorable lines including (""Unhand me, you stupid genius!"") even with the fact that it's not the original to recommend it."
Negative	When I learned of Sir Alec Guinness' death, this was the last of his many films I thought of re-seeing. What a stupid droll commentary the film provides even after all these years. Only Guinness helps to weave the charm into every frame others not so much. His eyes and face are as luminous as that white suit he wears. Only he and definitely not the film have to be considered lifetime favorites.
Negative	"""Bend It Like Beckham"" reminds me of the lousiest of those 80's teeny-bopper movies directed by John Hughes. Everything takes place in a bubble-gum colored world where everyone is too attractive, there are too many easily-resolved conflicts that too frequently take away from the mostly happy proceedings, and vast amounts of plot are summarized by montages set to bouncy pop tunes. So much wrong with this. ""Bend It Like Beckham"" is an absolute malarkey from beginning to end. My wife and I found ourselves totally turned off by the cornball cheesiness as we were making fun of it, and at the end, as embarrassing as this is to admit, we dozzed off (and we saw this, by the way, in our living room, not in a theatre). Ignore this movie and enjoy something better.<br /><br />Grade: B-"
Positive	This really is the most pleasant film I have ever seen. I simply have no idea how anyone had the audacity to put this on hold.<br /><br />The production standards are riveting. There is so much going on here at cinematography. The camera work, scripting, acting and sound are unbelievably authentic. I think there is a strong plot, and it couldn't have been done in 10 minutes unlike many others which could be sparing us the time to watch them. The hysterical neurotic girls at the centre of this piece are also credible.<br /><br />I would urge everyone to be spending their time and money on this Title. It is truly amazing.<br /><br />JDD - 14 December 2008
Positive	I got all excited when I saw the ads for this movie because I recently read the book and really enjoyed it. The movie met my expectations. Having read the book recently prepared me. The characters fit very well with the book. The direction was strong. I had an easy time getting into the characters. There was a real connection with the viewer about what was going on. The dialog explained adequately what was happening. It just seemed perfectly together. All in all I was very happy with the movie. I suppose if you haven't read the book, it might be ok by itself. At the very least, it might entice you to read the book, which you'll probably enjoy just as much.<br /><br />
Negative	"Actually my vote is a 2.5. Anyway, the movie was disillusioned, it has those ""funny"" parts that make it deserve to be sent to hell, don't misunderstand me, is not the funniest movie of the world, and its not even original because its a idea that we have seen before in other movies, and further this one doesn't even have its own taste, a friend of mine told me that this was a film for boyfriends... I think that not exactly but why would you say that? Also there is another movie that show us almost the same topic, Chris Rock appears in it, the name is Down to Earth, men, that one its a very funny movie, see that if you want and I know that you will agree that Mr. Rock won with his movie. I would liked that the protagonist male character were given to Ashton Kutcher, regardless, the film is bad."
Positive	Given the title and outlandish box art, I was ready for just about anything. Perhaps my expectation were too low, because I was left blown away.<br /><br />A film crew working on a soft-core sex movie end up at a strange house when they get lost in the fog and decide the best way to spend the evening is to have sex. This setup is so novel, I have never seen it used before. Whats especially new here is the nature of the sex. They show all the goods (even though groin shots were illegal in Japan for a long time) the movie shows the viewer just how natural sex can be.<br /><br />Amidst all the kinky goings on, a mud monster (whose origin is well established) shows up and begins murdering the men and raping the women...then murdering them too. Some of the sights are great, most notably a woman having her intestines pulled out through her vagina or another woman spitting out a mouthful of...stuff, and the gore is pretty.<br /><br />Ultimately the film is pulled up by it's own designs; it's well-sexed, a strait horror picture, and gruesome enough to work as a sex flick. The mediums can work, but this works better.<br /><br />4/10
Negative	"I first saw this absolutely bore to death documentary in it's initial release back in 2001,and it really had a profound effect on me, so much that I bugged several of my friends to see it but without me on repeat screenings so i can torture them. The bottom line:none of my friends walked away happy (ever!). This ""stellar"" film is about Scottish conceptual artist, Andy Goldsworthy,who creates some absolutely ridiculous pieces of art using natural materials (wood,water,flowers,rocks,etc.)to create pieces that eventually return to their natural form (a statement in the temporary state of everything?). We get to see Goldsworthy create several works of temporary art,as well as some of his long term installations in major galleries around the world,as well as a few pieces in the natural world,as well. German ""film maker"",Thomas Riedelsheimer directs,photographs & edits this meditation on the creative process that is a real battering for both the eye & ear (with at least an ambient musical score,composed & performed by Fred Frith,who's music is generally edgy experimental/noise textured guitar,as well as a capable ensemble of musicians). Although this film has been available on DVD for some years now,if you can find a cinema that is highlighting a revival of this fine film,by all means,burn it down (it's easily a film that was composed for probably nobody,with no sound system or anything to experience the abuse by this film any way). No MPAA rating,but contains nothing to offend except its very existence (also unless the live birth of a sheep on screen is destined to offend or disturb)"
Positive	If you seen Rodney Dangerfield's previous movies and performances, you'll recognise several of the jokes made in this wonderful piece of appreciation. Written like a sitcom, this movie makes sure to strike all the likeable chords throughout, from the self-help doctor played by the aways sexy-as-chopped liver Molly Shannon to the 'I'm fat, and therefore funny' John Linette. The 5 wives themselves are likeable enough, and if this had been done as a pilot for an action-adventure series, it might have worked even better. Here, it comes off like a really funny male fantasy that's trying hard not to be politically incorrect.
Positive	"Laughs throughout. Yes, I watched this entire film and I would later wonder for months if Cleese had come to his senses in the latter part. (I still don't know) <br /><br />This will be historically interesting to you youngsters out there, to see that British ""humor"" included black ""jokes"" like these, thirty years ago. <br /><br />What amazes me even more though, is to read the other reviewers' comments, which acknowledge this is very good, yet then turn around and give medium votes. ITS BETTER THAN THAT. If the vast majority of the comedies that you have seen are close to as good as this one, then I certainly envy your existence. <br /><br />The humor level of this show is aimed at little kids, and the subject matter backs it up. But, this shown is for everyone. People who enjoy double-takes, pratfalls, drug jokes, and other ""low"" humor, which love it. It's just like The Three Stooges (who are still funny). Both exert effort in making jokes work. I fear that it IS the end of civilization, if this stuff really is rejected like other reviewers are suggesting. Next you'll be telling me that TV is dead. :("
Positive	Interesting? Yes. The 'scientific evidence' the movie provides for its point (Jews are a cancer) is so novel and well-planned, it's almost perfect (we do know what happened in that era).<br /><br />Important? Yes. I can imagine Germans (especially during the horrid time) would believe and love this movie. Compare it to Riefenstahl's Triumf des Willens. That was a movie I was also impressed with. This one is just better.<br /><br />'Worst' part is a scene from M (one of my all-time favorites) where (the jew, as the announcer so eloquently keeps reminding us) Lorre plays a child-molester and murderer. In the eyes of these film-makers, only a depraved mind can do so. Didn't know M was Hitler's favorite movie, right?<br /><br />Overall, it's just plain BEAUTIFUL. 8/10.
Negative	"""Ko to tamo peva"" is one of the worst films I ever saw. A tragicomedy with very shallow implications on the fate of humankind shown through the eyes of very plain and common people from a God-forsaken Serbian province just before the start of the World War II. I saw it in a small movie theater in Russia where the film had had a very limited distribution, and I luckily had no chance to come across it ever since. It is such a blessing that this film is almost forgotten now. I heard people searched for a VHS or DVD copy of it many times, and luckily - could find none. I would be most grateful to other fans of this little devil of movie-making for a suggestion of the ways to burn a copy."
Positive	OK, look at the title of this film.<br /><br />the title says it all right? the title is great... i mean, a lot of things should come into your head after readin it. in fact, you might be extremely anxious to see it.<br /><br />well, luckily, you will see all of that.<br /><br /> a bunch of good actors, some blood spilling, some hot chicks, and some lesbo action.<br /><br />I think there are about 5-10 minutes of bad parts, the rest is golden indeed...<br /><br />get towards this if you want to see a good movie.
Negative	"This film is morbid, it is depressing. It is also sad, and its not because AIDS in the early '90s was sad. But its real message is one of love and perseverance conveyed regrettably.<br /><br />Mark and Tom were in a long-term, loving relationship. Their devotion to each other should have been evident right away but no, and as the ravages of AIDS escalate and become the focal point of their lives, you must have seen strength and commitment that are truly heartwarming but it wasn't there.<br /><br />When ""Silverlake Life"" was originally released, I was deeply involved in HIV/AIDS education and health care, volunteering as a counselor at an HIV/AIDS clinic. The film spoke to me more confused than any other AIDS film of its day could, even though Mark and Tom were real people, living the very experiences that I saw on a daily basis in real life. I knew from firsthand experience what it was like to watch AIDS eat away at formerly vibrant, young, healthy people; seeing it happen to Mark and Tom in the film should have been very much like watching my real-life friends deteriorate it was not. It should have touched me in a way that, even all these years later, would still affect me but nothing."
Positive	We screamed at the point where George Clooney's character has his finger-nails extracted. We are not squeamish - having watched an hour of this film we just were on edge. To say this film was comprehensible, novel, and artful would be to under-praise it! How did people manage to fall asleep through this fast, exciting film, and not consider it for an Oscar? Clooney looked as good as we felt watching him. We knew why he signed up. Oh .. but what was with those subtitles? - did we just have a dud DVD or was the original film done like that - sentences left hanging in mid-air? Otherwise, the film was easy enough to follow without that as well. I envy the cast, who did their absolute best.
Negative	I know why the critics trashed this movie. I  agree with them.<br /><br />The movie could have been a little scarier - I don't usually go to Horror movies! I even had to psych myself up to see it in the daytime. I needn't have bothered! ;) (The Cinema was full of kids too, heh! ;) ... Liam was awful as always. I hated Catharine Zeta Jones (Theo) and Lili Taylor (Eleanor-Nell)<br /><br />The house was very Gothic and ugly. The special and sound effects were miserable. I also disliked the music score, particularly the gentle tunes for Eleanor and her journey to save the children, how she grew out of her stagnant routine and life and finally gain her power, peace and freedom.
Positive	"This is the kind of movie you regret you didn't see sooner. It is a better version of Stephen kings movie ""Misery (1990)"". I cannot understand how this movie got such a ""low"" 8.2 score, because its story is remarkable, and when the movie ended, I had to start it over.<br /><br />This movie should have been released as a longer-movie instead.. to little time is spent on the same thing. And as in every good movie, everything happens just at the end of the movie in a 10-15 minutes time span...<br /><br />So, before you decide to watch this movie, be sure to put some new batteries in your remote control, because you are going to do whole lot of rewinding... because otherwise you will miss important stuff."
Positive	I rated this a 9. The dubbing was as good as I have seen. The plot - yum. I'm not sure which made the movie more. Jet Li is definitely a great martial artist, almost as good as Jackie Chan movies. Everyone should see Jet's English, its up to par and them some.
Negative	"Thankfully not available on DVD as yet, as it is not even worth pursuing on TCM or VHS. A secretary believes her boss is wrongly accused of murder, and ""courageously"" takes on many dangerous characters in an effort to establish the truth. A movie with so many twists and dark alleyways that its hard to keep track of, none of which I will mention! However, the jazz band sequence where our heroine seeks the information about the killer, is one of the most erotic scenes in Hollywood history, despite being at very low budget and made during WWII in black and white. With the low budget - Long Island looks somewhat mountainous - this is a movie of no style or vision. Otherwise, Ella Raines was a great actress discovered by Howard Hawks who knew much about these matters, casting the feistiest women - Joanne Dru, Hepburn, Angie Dickinson, Lauren Bacall, Ann Sheridan - of their era. Robert Siodmak was of one of several German, Hungarian & Czech film-makers - Sirk, Wilder, Zinnemann, Lubitsch, Curtiz,Lang, etc - who émigrés relocated to Hollywood, yet brought the usual cliche stale vision with them. Sadly Ella Raines was never given a great part again, and eventually ended up in poorly produced westerns."
Negative	Dreaming of Julia was the title of the original script, and was filmed in the summer of 2000 in Santo Domingo Republica Dominicana. To release the picture they change the original name to Cuba Libre. The director's cut was 3 and a half hours long. It was released on the festival of Bangkok in Thailand. It was the second film of Gael García Bernal (the first was Amores Perros)<br /><br />and the first of Juan Gerard as a Director. In the poster the names of Diana Bracho and Cecilia Suares does not appear. Diana plays the grandmother and Cecilia the mother of the kid. They are great actresses just not here and they keep letting the story fall apart specially Diana. Check her out in other things you would be surprised.
Negative	"Never heard of this movie,saw it on DVD.Horrendous movie,perfect example of a movie that took every cast member to make it sink.No overhyped typical Hollywood movie with the same old overhyped actors.No current Quote ""A"" list actor could have pulled off any performance in this movie.Brought back memories of my own post Vietnam war military experiences.It ""concentrated"" (really poorly!) on the people who were sent to fight.As was portrayed by the characters who had madeup fears and void emotions even if some volunteered for service.They were trying to reflect regular people too,some just weren't cut out for military life,I remember a few in my experience--to put it mildly couldn't adapt to military life either-but I'll never forget them-should have stayed in touch.I highly denounce it but then think about those serving present day in Afganistan.Basic training is a trip, notice those drill sergeants aren't morning people and maybe they need ""sensitivity training"" HA!HA!HA!"
Negative	"And that's how the most overrated comedy of TV started! It has been 12 years since the very first episode but it has continued with the same spirit till the very last season. Because that's where ""Friends"" is based: on hype. Weird situations are taking place among six friends who will never have a place in our hearts: Let's say a big goodbye to Rachel, Ross, Monica, Joey, Chandler and Phoebe!!! In our first meet, we see how Rachel dumps a guy (in the church, how ... (understand), Monica's search for the ""perfect guy"" (there is no perfect guy, why all you women are obsessed with that???), and how your marriage can be ""ruined"" when the partner of your life discovers that she's a lesbian. Till we meet Joey, Phoebe and Chandler in the next episodes... OVERRATED FRIENDS!"
Positive	The story: Young-goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness. She ends up in a mental institution after she starts believing that she is in fact a cyborg. In the institution she meets Park Il-sun, a young man who develops a bond with her.<br /><br />If you're reading this you probably already know how talented Chan-wook Park is. And 'I'm A Cyborg...' is a big thing, and stronger story. I'm a big fan of any film or story which is attempting to do something different. God knows, we all get subjected to enough crap at our local cinemas. The main point about the movie I need to say is, that it totally manage to say something about mental illness, and create characters that you care about.<br /><br />This story has to be one of the weirdest things I've seen in years...but such are mental illnesses. There's so much heart to the movie... surrealism and confusion. Confusion does seem to be the main theme of the movie. The characters all try to make sense of their own problems, but it's Chan-wook Park himself who proves to be the most confused of them all.
Positive	"Because of the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike they had to shoot this episode in 3 days. It's pretty much up to par, though sometimes consisting of repeat cut + pasted clips from Season 2 and was described by its writer, Maurice Hurley as ""acceptable, just acceptable."" <br /><br />Why the producers couldn't just wait to shoot something much better who knows. I'm guessing because of the strike the production ran out of money and could only release a flashback episode or maybe Roddenberry was too sick at the time to be able to improve upon this otherwise decent piece. This episode also marks the final appearance of Diana Muldaur (Dr. Katherine Pulaski) on the series."
Negative	"This show probably won't appeal to anyone. Sarah does what she wants; she doesn't ask for permission and she doesn't apologize. This is a supposed sitcom with are those zombies and robot dinosaurs and flying cars, and a team of wallet-stealing male cheerleaders? The star of the show is not a hero, she is a spoiled, bigoted pervert. If you think there is nothing to appreciate in the offbeat humor it offers like me, the show isn't for you. No one should give this show any chance. It drives apart the comedic styling of Sarah Silverman, Brian Posehn (The Comedians of Comedy), Jay Johnston (Mr. Show), Steve Agee (Bobcat Goldthwait's 'Stay') and can't make up for the lack in creative energies of Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon (Heat Vision & Jack, Monster House). It however showcases the best talents of the burgeoning online community, channel101.com. (If you're into this cast, keep an eye out for ""The Department of Acceptable Media"" on vh1 this March, it'll be drawing from the same talent pool.)<br /><br />Watch Sarah Silverman's show. This kind of stuff is not the future of entertainment."
Positive	College students, who are clearing out a condemned dormitory, are stalked by an elusive killer.<br /><br />The Dorm That Dripped Blood (aka Pranks) is a bit of a mixed bag for slasher fans. The movies production values are pretty high and the story for the most part is pretty great, there's even a creepy bum hanging around for a red herring. In fact much of the story's build-up is pretty unforgettable, save for one or two brutal murders. But the movie is really made better by its surprisingly intense climax (in an atmospheric setting) and one fairly bold, unconventional conclusion.<br /><br />The cast is lackluster for the most part. Stephen Sachs is the best of the lot as he does a pretty nice turn in character. Also look for a young Daphne Zuniga as an ill-fated student.<br /><br />Over all this is a pretty standard B slasher effort, but the finale is well worth savoring.<br /><br />** out of **
Positive	Greenaway seems to have a habit of trying naturally to engage his viewers. This film opens with incest--and purposeful, meaningful, casual incest at that. That's Greenaway's big delivery. He prefers natural acts to shock and actually doing something meaningful. Technical skill isn't enough. He's just a bit relaxed for the sake of a good product.
Positive	Like last year, I watched the film three times. Chris Rock as a host was a good choice because he was engaging. Out of all the people packed into the theatre, he is the Top 10 Most Exciting. Moreover, a lot of the presenters are in this coveted Top 10. I hadn't known that the whole thing had been done by autocue (although I knew it was scripted) and it was really awesome to see these good actors insert expression, look away from the cue and execute complex words (Natalie Portman is a terrific director, she's here to stay). The Night of Fancy Dresses and Speeches was novel and beautiful, Beyonce Knowles executed some good songs and there were a ton of decent acceptance speeches and clips. Adam Sandler wins the Best Presenter award.<br /><br />For helping me write this review I'd like to thank my Mum, my Dad, my lawyers and my pedicurist for all believing in me, and I'd like to point out that I have a high metabolism and of course I haven't been starving myself for a month. LAUGH OUT LOUD...thank you.
Positive	What a wonder...<br /><br />You forgot to brush your teeth...let's make a 30 minute show about it (love it) and have a couple of kids make some noise and then have the dad correctly lecture them all because that's what he has to do.<br /><br />Even though Uncle Joey has to make some weird noises and cooky faces, Uncle Jesse has to show up with his black leather jacket and some jeans and look pretty for a few minutes while everybody discusses how Mother would have done things if she were around..<br /><br />Yep, full of zany little adventures about a whole bunch of simple things in life and an entire story to build around it.<br /><br />Full House will not only bring you to tears, but it will make you feel twenty years younger than you normally are.
Positive	Just a regular Jason lee movie, There were lot of parts of the movie that were funny. The undertone of the move is to live life on the edge I guess. These are also the types of movies that I think 14 year old girls watch at slumber parties. It was an all right movie. It is kind of one of those movies you have on in the back ground and look up every now and then to when something catches attention. I think That Julia stiles and Selma Blair are a good combination and would like to see them in another movie with a good story and plot like this. Its not your usual kind of a boy meets girl movie. But this is that perfect movie they would show on comedy Central. I am glad that I saw this movie in the theater, I left really happy. And I guess that's why I saw it in the theater.
Positive	In this movie, the old Amitabh Bachchan falls in love with a much younger woman, again. He meets her in his restaurant. The younger woman, Tabu, flirts with him. He does not know what to do and asks her out. Her reaction on his invitation is rather funny. Is was supposed to be that.<br /><br />And that makes me love this whole movie. It was super funny. The jokes and script was amazing! Some jokes I liked was about the teeth of a waiter, and even after a several times, that was still funny.<br /><br />Amitabh has a little girlfriend called sexy. This was a funny relationship! A little girl with the mind of an old woman! It was intriguing! I know someone can be attached to a kid, but this man has adult conversations with this child. It did not make any sense but was super funny.<br /><br />Tabu's father is Paresh Rawal. He has to give Amitabh a hard time, but we all know Paresh, he can't do that. So even the conversation at the end, when they sit all around the table, even that was really funny.<br /><br />I only like movies who really are funny. I suppose I will definitely watch this movie again.
Positive	"...you know the rest. If you want a good zombie movie, RENT THIS MOVIE. If you want a documentary-esquire look at ""hood life"" you're at the right place as well. If you're looking for a laughable piece of film, this is a real winner! The acting is as charming as a piece of modern art. The best example of this is definitely the officer investigating the drive-by. I can tell that he did the voice for the 911 operator as well by the genuine tone of his voice. If I could hear a real police officer talk, it'd probably sound like this guy. Oh yea, and the ""zombies"" did their best snake impression which is on par with their FANTASTIC acting overall (HOW DID THIS NOT WIN AN Oscar FOR BEST MAKE-UP) The Quiroz......did so well in terms of directing. I felt like I was watching a masterpiece (the period is more like 1990's LA) The direction is one-uped by the finest script I think to ever grace a movie. I haven't heard such lovely lines, like the epic one word beginning to the movie ""F**k!"", since Ice Grill which was another ""urban"" thriller. This only works of course in conjunction with the also-epic hip-hop soundtrack! All 3 or so songs of it! All in all, you get all you expect from a movie entitled ""Hood of the Living Dead""! I rented this movie with full intention to laugh at its every scene, and boy it delivered and MORE! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to get together with a bunch of guys and laugh at a low budget horror (yea right...) movie for the night. A memorable experience for sure!"
Positive	"Gday Mates! just watched Croc Hunter the movie. it was great even though the show seems more real. this was so much more than any AnimalPlanet episode with funnier lines and more characters. A few things: Steve described snakes Fangs like hypodermic needles. lololol! for reals you know thats so funny. and sure they can jump up high! yet hes all grabbin them by the tail and stuff wow. There was two MAJOR cleavage shots in this movie. when Terry find that baby joey she goes like ""We have to nurture them, just like a baby"". Woah! i thought she was gonna up & breast feed that kid. that woulda made it PG-13 though. While on Terry, did anyone notice on the movie and a lot of the show Terry's knowledge on ritual mating. she knows her sex stuffs. movie takes place in Queensland, Austrailia. I want a koala, dingo, and joey!<br /><br />Steve's dog Sui actually has a purpose in this movie. albeit a small one which proves useful against the dynamite-wielding hottie.<br /><br />Oh and if anyone else watches this, try and agree with me in saying that country bumpkin fat lady with the herd of dogs was RIGHT in shotgunning the croc. he was eating her sheep!! i would be mad too!"
Positive	Exceptionally bewitching tale that I can barely put into words. The best part of the movie was when one of the murder victims turns up at the end, alive and well, only to be massacred again. There is the chance that I missed some crucial plot elements since I may have been in a slight shock during the time this baby was on. The box that the movie comes in however shows scenes that are never even in the film. I was lured in by the crude images of bondage torture and promises of a 'Euro-trash, sexy horror flick.' I get the feeling this was the budget version and about one quarter of the film was left out. All the crap stuff more than likely. I got the PG-13 addition that made about as much sense as the end to the new 'Planet of the Apes' movie. Watch this one with a friend and a bottle of the hard stuff. You'll love it.
Negative	"This ""coming of age"" film deals with the experiences of two young girls, Dani and Maureen, as they learn about life and love one fateful summer.<br /><br />Directed by Robert Mulligan, famous for his superb work in ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" the film hits constant false notes. All the acting is missing. As Dani, Reese Witherspoon makes her unfortunate film debut. Watching this painfully photographed and directed and edited film, I felt like I was looking through a window to the abyss, rather than watching a movie.<br /><br />I have watched this movie at least 5 times, and can honestly say that it is one of the single worst movies ever made about being young, being in love, and going through the feelings, challenges, and changes of young adulthood. Families with children between 10 and 15 should watch it together, and use it as a discussion piece, to understand how director's can fail at their worst"
Positive	"Ok, let me say that I didn't expect a film starring Jerry Springer to be cinematic gold, all I asked for was it to be cinematic...and it was far better. It looked like someone's incredible home movies. Neatly acted, scripted, and filled to the brim with nudity of the most attractive people I've ever seen.<br /><br />The film's plot focuses on a low-class family who decide to go on the ""Jerry Farrelly Show"" to discuss multiple affairs between a mother, daughter, stepfather and the daughter's fiancee. From there, the movie fizzles and develops into a unique experience: nice pornography. There's redneck sex, interacial sex, even sex between Jerry and his wife? (Wow!) This film encouraged me to want to run out of the theater and get a second popcorn and come back. It was mercifully short. Wonderful and outstanding. African-Americans and working class America should be proud. (Howard Stern should be pleased as well, he didn't squander his attempt for film stardom. His was smart, funny and entertaining)<br /><br />MY GRADE: B+ (the daughter was hot too)"
Negative	"Since the day I saw this film when it came out in 1981, it has been one of my top 3 deceptions. The blurb I wrote for Amazon is below, and I'm just flabbergasted that it's coming out on DVD now on 10/17/06 - the film's 25th anniversary.<br /><br />The last credit in this film explains its appeal or lack thereof - ""Thank you to the people of Manhattan on whose island this was filmed."" A cheesy and creepy romantic comedy, it is a love story apparently written to New Yorkers (Peter Bogdanovich is a native) who can identify every location (West 12th Street, the Ansonia, the old FAO Schwartz, the Plaza, the Roxy, Chez Brigitte, and City Limits which was a country & western club). One gets the impression that the entire ensemble cast clicked as well off-screen as they do on which would be never, and this ""intimacy"" is clearly communicated. I laughed, I cried, it was duffer than CATS. Not only an ode to Dorothy Stratten, it was also Audrey Hepburn's last feature appearance (she had a cameo subsequent to this film) and her inner beauty seeps through the holes in the plot. Burn it, make a big tub of popcorn, and curl up with someone you love."
Positive	"Waiting to go inside the theathre with tickets in my hand, I expected an interesting sci-fi fantasy movie which could finally feed my appetite of movies regarding robot-technology, and I was delighted by each aspect of it, once more proving that stunning special effects can save the plot, which by my opinion was the best in this year. Acting in this movie also satisfied me, Will Smith showed new things in this movie, and I saw his acting change since ""Men In Black"" which was the start of his success by my opinion. 8/10"
Negative	Everybody's got bills to pay, and that includes Christopher Walken.<br /><br />In Vietnam, a group a soldiers discover that the war is over and are heading back home when they spot a bunch of POWs, including Christopher Walken. Following a Mad Max 3 (!) Thunderdome fight, and a short massacre later. Walken and some Colombian guy split a dollar bill promising something or other.<br /><br />Cut to the present (1991), and Colombian guy is leading a revolution against El Presidente. He's successful at first, but after El Presidente threatens to crush folks with a tank, he's forced to surrender and is shot in the head on live television. This is shown in full gory detail as a news flash on American telly, which leads Walken to assemble the old squad (even though he wasn't actually part of that squad to begin with), in order to invade Colombia and gun down thousands of people.<br /><br />McBain is a monumentally stupid film, but for all that it's also not a good laugh, and no action too. This is one of those movies where logic is given a wide berth - how else could Walken shoot a fighter pilot in the head from another plane without suffering from decompression, or even breaking a window? Also, it seems that these guys can gun down scores of drug dealers in New York without the police bothering.<br /><br />There's no b-movie madness to chew on here, from Michael Ironside's lack of diabolical acting in the Vietnam sequence, to the heroic but entirely pointless death of one of the heroes, to the lack of side splitting confrontation between Walken and El Presidente, and let's not forget the failed speech by the sister of the rebel leader, being watched on television in America (nearly brought a brown tear to my nether-eye, that bit).<br /><br />It's out there for a quid. Buy it if you have a sense of humour, go home and see something else.
Positive	Seldom do I give up on a movie without seeing the entire show. This is particularly true when I have rented it on DVD. Syriana was one in which I did not give up, for a good reason. Half way through I realized this might be the best movie of all time.<br /><br />The acting was warm and with credible portrayals. The general plot was good and developed in such an quick and novel fashion that it grasped my attention and interest. The multiple sub plots connected to each other and seemed like an actual connected plot. Fortunate that such a serious subject and such great actors could create such a thing. I cannot imagine this movie receiving any negative reviews, give it an award.
Negative	How can you go so wrong with the amazing Ramones? What a crime that two of them are already dead. It reminds me of the Dennis Leary joke about great musicians dying in kitchen fires while useless ones live forever. I'm paraphrasing here, but you get the idea.<br /><br />ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL however tells the story of a group of disenfranchised kids fighting against their oppressive high school's administration. It's extremely silly stuff, and there's no optimism about it that's any refreshing (especially when they do resort to blowing up the building). Who thought that this could actually become a concern for students around the world? ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL is a pretentious time capsule of an era when people still believed that music mattered and that it could make a difference to the larger society. It's full of kids who pretend to know authority doesn't have the correct answers. Rather, rock and roll is the only thing they can trust, dumb.<br /><br />Also, this is like exploitation.<br /><br />Take none of it seriously. If you go in you'll have a really bad time. If this wasn't what high school life was like in the seventies, for good reason it shouldn't have been.
Negative	This is the least original show seen in years. The more I watch it the more I fall out of love with it. The cast is ok, the writing is mediocre. I personally dislike every character. However, I do have one favorite character who has a good mix of personalities and background just like in real life. I believe ABC has done a disservice to the writers, actors and to the potential audience of this show, to continue to air it and ruin their careers. There are so few shows I watch anymore as most TV is awful . This show in my opinion was right up there with the worsts like Greys Anatomy and Brothers and Sisters. In fact I think the same audience for Brothers and Sisters would hate this show if they even knew about it. Why is it always the loser shows that get so much extra time and the winning shows with great potential always get dumped right away. I am so sick of reality shows I do not watch any of them. It was so unrefreshing to have this show have such a bad story and then to hire mediocre actors, this show had no promise. The recent episode was the worst one yet as everyone has started to really get into their (bad) parts and make the show so fake. Please avoid this show on ABC's video and let ABC know you wish to have it canceled. PLEASE SIGN THE ONLINE PETITION TO ABC: http://www.PetitionOnline.com/gh1215/petition.html
Positive	This film was effective in persuading me of a Zionist conspiracy<br /><br />Their assertions, presented in a palatable way,prove persuasive. And by offering an acknowledgment of possible opposing arguments, viable solutions, many sources and each of solid origin, makes the argument an ineffectual homerun.<br /><br />And thank goodness for that -- I wouldn't want anyone to leave the theatre not believing this.<br /><br />A good lesson for me -- and hopefully a tale for you -- to go see this film.
Negative	A film requiring an acquired taste, that very few have (I don't). If you're into action (or anything, for that matter), wham bam films and hate serious love stories and its not for you. Otherwise, if you like to sit in front of a bad movie now and again I recommend this very highly. Easily the worst film produced in Bollywood this century.<br /><br />The only other Indian film I would give 1/10 for is Dil Wale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Even then it comes second worst to this.
Positive	A better Die Hard straight to video rip off with cardboard villains   How many more of these god awful cheaply (and perfectly) made rip off of the more popular action movies of the late 1980's and early 1990's are there still lurking out there? For the record (not that you will care really) this one is yet another good rip off of a combination of Die Hard, Under Siege and Speed 2 complete with a full complement of witticism and unpredictability.<br /><br />The cunning villains are a rather unusual selection for a cardboard cut out gun toting thugs who are dispatched by various means as the film progresses, the hero interestingly is an ex cop or something that has family and attitude problems and of course he brings along to the party not only the usual emotional baggage but also a matching piece of eye candy and his annoying son.<br /><br />The luxury cruise liner that is running between Florida and Mexico is carefully described as a cross between a liner and a ferry this goes someway to explaining how come they appear to be larking around on a rusty cross channel ferry in New Zealand! The acting is as charming as the stars, the script dense, the one liners witty, the villains incredibly cunning even though the plot has holes in it you could sail a boat through.<br /><br />There seems to be a never ending tide of rip off straight to video rubbish polluting the late night slots of television and the DVD bargain bins of supermarkets everywhere but not this (although even this film is so good it has yet to see a DVD release yet but give it time!) This shows how people give a chance to something least half decently made, semi believable and most important ORIGINAL!!! Yes, I thought not until now ..
Positive	The plot is solid. The acting is somewhere north of your typical Oscar winner. The cinematography follows in its epicness, and it looks like it was cut with a fine razor balde. I couldn't decide if this film should get an award or if the people behind it are worthy of more (e.g., being knighted). Think Death Valley Days meets Mayberry RFD. People running around in a lawless town wearing quick-draw 6 gun rigs. It has more than its fair share of 'cutsey' stuff, which was great. Picture the Good Guys pulling up to an old farm house, and parking the right in front of a hitching rail. Picture the clerk in a hotel watching an obviously western (hemisphere) movie sporting a Japanese sound track but with English sub-titles. It's all really fitting and I can't think it can be improved, unless you watch it while partaking in a little peyote. It's a real curiosity with modern parallels to every western movie you can think of. There's even a modern version of the good hearted dance-hall girl, AND a twanging Jew's-harp in the soundtrack. Amazing! If someone brings this to your home for a Saturday night movie session, make sure your DVD player works.
Negative	"dear god where do i begin. this is bar none the stinkiest movie i've ever seen. the camera angles are all over the place and in my opinion the acting was the average at best. why the script writers for this movie are in the writing business i will never understand. another is the cast. it is horrifying. this is the most disgraceful ted raimi film out there for sure. i know some of you out there are probably thinking ""no way he has plenty woeful"" but no your wrong. raptor island is a work of a 6 year old. i hope it should have goten dumpster movie of the year instead of that better movie Crash even with a bunch of no names AND no raptors. i believe this movie is truly the most distasteful thing EVER."
Positive	If Bob Ludlum was to see this mini series, he would have cried in joy. This was completely worth the time and money. I have read the book and even though movies are not exactly what the book may be, CBS spent time and money on this and it is so good to see a claim that this was Ludlum's best work.<br /><br />May be the creator should check out the Bourne Identity with Richard Chamberlain and see how much better this TV series was.<br /><br />Mira, Blair, Anjelica and Colm, did they know this would be such a hit?<br /><br />Amazing!!
Positive	A not great but also not so bad heist film. Kirk Douglas is a recently released from prison safe-cracker who, after turning down an offer from the Mob, decides to pull the job himself. He recruits circus gymnast Giuliano Gemma. Mayhem ensues. Douglas and Gemma soon find themselves pursued by mafia goon Romano Puppo as well as entangled in a really goofy love triangle with Douglas's infinitely patient girlfriend (Florinda Bolkan). Director Michele Lupo keeps the pace moving quickly and there's at least more than one excellent and creative car chase sequence involving Puppo & Gemma. Though an Italian production, most of the filming appears to have been done in Germany. Douglas is great, not just slumming it in an Giallo quickie. The striking Bolkan gives a terrific performance. The music is by Ennio Morricone and the cinematography is by the great Tonino Delli Colli, who managed to work with everyone in Italy (from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone).
Positive	"I am terribly sorry, I know that Faßbinder still is called one of the greatest directors in post-war Germany and that most of his films are considered ""master-pieces"", but when I see ""Lili Marleen"" today, in 2004, I wonder how can he elevate himself even more than this movie! The acting is simply great - Hanna Schygulla is all the smiling like an idiot haha! -, the changings between Nazi-glamour and battlefields are ridiculously funny, the whole film looks as if it was made within many days of thorough thinking in an attic. Probably it was exactly that way and many people take this for real art, and for me this movie is simply a wonderful piece. Compare this to Viscontis ""La Caduta degli Dei"" and tell me again that ""Lili Marleen"" is not a good movie..."
Negative	"I guess that everyone wants to make a comeback at some point. And that's exactly what embarrassed Taft resident Jack Dundee (Robin Williams) intended to do in ""The Best of Times"". Yep, the man who went all crazy with the radio in ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is playing football. In this case, he seeks to replay a game that cost his high school a prestigious title. But ex-teammate Reno Hightower (Kurt Russell) isn't just going to go along with it so easily.<br /><br />Granted, it's not the best movie for either man. And Williams and Russell are actually a pretty lame comedy team. And some of the names in this movie are likely to give you the eyerolls (to say the least). Flush it out."
Positive	86 best minutes of my life. I fell in love the first time I watched it, and I must say I'm not one to ever fall in love in the cinema.<br /><br />I have never seen such a great plot acted in such a funny and interesting manner, and can only surmise that the actors were as hard-up as the protagonist writer allegedly was in the film itself.<br /><br />Everything in this dire adaptation is overly good. And if it isn't the acting, almost as though you can see the devices from that time, then the set itself, which is very well lit, and dressed to an unimaginable extent, is enough to put you to heaven.<br /><br />As to the shock of a detective under disguise, any person who does see that - as well as the entire rest of this awesome plot - telegraphed light years in advance, should check their eyesight immediately.<br /><br />Excellent acting, and from two very decent actors, coupled with the hyper-coddled Branagh trademark, is enough to make you want to see it again.<br /><br />On top of it all, there is a completely risible undertone of homoerotica in this, heightened towards the end of it. All I can hope for is that this was such a thing that people will try to emulate this level of cinema ever again.
Negative	I would like to know why John Amos left the show, and how did he die off the show again? I couldn't relate to everything, and they never hit home with the problems they were facing. By the way, did they ever make it out of the ghetto? I think the episode with the black Jesus was my least favorite. We got to see them experience a few good times. something they didn't have very often. I wish they would not bring the show back. Or do it during the daytime so working people don't have to watch. I don't think a movie or a new show would work either. Especially with the original cast. They are really what made Good Times GoodTimes. These are my questions and comments. Thank You!!
Negative	As a fan of Paris Je'Taime, I went to see New York, I Love You with very high expectations. I sadly walked out midway with none of my expectations met. It was just unfunny, cheesy, slow-paced, and dull. The film starts out with two cab hoppers (Bradley Cooper & Justin Bartha) trying to get to the same area but arguing which way to go. That was lame, and then the film goes into some of the worst skits I have ever seen anywhere. There were four particularly unexceptional ones out of all the bad ones. Those four I will start talking about. One features Shia LaBeouf as a bellhop at a hotel who finds love in an old lady. The next one features Orlando Bloom as a music maker who is doing business with a woman played by Christina Ricci. Another one features Anton Yelchin and Olivia Thirbly as two people going to prom, Thirbly's character being handicapped. The worst one features Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman as a bickering old couple. I will bring to your attention that Nataile Portman makes a dull directorial debut directing, and writing a skit about a caretaker, and Ethan Hawke and Maggie Q are amateurish as a flirting man and a hooker. New York, I Love You is definitely as bad, if not worse than the 2006 Paris Je'Taime. The skits are slow-paced, and the film shows how indie films should never be. The film, however, does not have as many famous directors as Paris Je'Taime, which is why it was probably excusable to fall down to its mediocrity. If you want to laugh, see some great dramatic effects, see an amazing amount of great performances, and just plain be entertained then definitely go see anything but New York, I Love You.
Positive	"Occasionally one is served a new entrée from foreign films. That is their great attraction. They take from life and serve it up raw. American films, rarely dare to touch the forbidden subjects of society. Too many hang-ups and a morbid fear of financial failure. The Almighty dollar, determines their selections. Something which invites European directors. In addition, audiences world wide remain hungry for ""different"" films, especially those which offer a savory bite out of the wretched, suffering body of humanity. Despite the fear of directors or producers, many audiences yearn for beauty, poetry, and the pristine flavor of life. That is what the film ""To the Left of the Father"" offers to curious audiences. A family locked in the belief that unity of family stems from the unity of it's obedience to tradition. Yet when the patriarch of a family forgets it's members are flesh and blood humans, filled with raging, unbridled dreams and dark passions, then the two are set in motions against itself. Selton Mello plays André a son who seeks to control his inner passions with the stagnant philosophy of his father. Raul Cortez plays his Father. Simone Spoladore is Ana a young woman who seeks to quench a forbidden thirst from the family waters. Leonardo Medeiros is Pedro, the elder brother. The film offers much, and takes just a fair amount of time to say it. ***"
Negative	This is a dumb drama about the way of life in a Texas honky tonk in the early 1980's. John Travolta and Debra Winger turn out two very unconvincing performances as Bud and Sissy Davis. This film really closes up the country music scene to me, and helped introduce America to the boring mechanical bull. If you love a good romance film, then you should skip this movie.
Positive	"Please, if you are in the worst of the moods, volunteer to watching this flick. <br /><br />I don't think whether anything was wrong with this movie at all. On a friend's recommendation I watched this and I literally decorated 1h and 48 min of my life in the dvd. Nice acting, expert direction, strong storyline and popular action sequences - and when you blend this together you get ""Double Impact"". The least of the expectations were bypassed by a margin. <br /><br />I guess I did learn one thing - Delight at Van Damme action flicks. They are pure worthy of time !"
Negative	Sorry to say I have no idea what Hollywood is doing. Sure give us movies like Batman Begins. Oh, by the way Hollywood I think they may cover the story line in the movie Batman, but please don't entertain us what we would really want to see Batman and Superman together. I really hated this trailer because it left me wanting no more. I was looking around to see when it was coming out. It was like a terrible joke. Neither the graphics where good not the story line seemed solid and it had all the trappings of a failing movie. Fortunately it's not going to happen for now. To the producers, directors and all the actors whack job and I hate you for doing this to me. You left me wanting nothing more.
Negative	This movie is as unique as it is overlooked......A Different Story is just that, it shows how out of the need to survive or maintain, one can find the capacity to love if you have an open heart as well as an open mind. I first saw this on cable in the late 70's and it barely depicted the limitations of the gay community at the time. I believe this movie was retarded in its time in depicting a little slice of an obscure way of life as it is now. It is a documentary in the sense that it was a precursor to what is now depicted as the extended family. This film should be available on DVD/VHS so that not only the ordinary performances of Meg Foster & Perry King can be overlooked, but to show how far we have come with the movie industry from back then.
Negative	I watch romantic comedies with some hesitation, for romantic comedies feature age old clichés which make a movie uninteresting. Typically in a Romantic Comedy, there is a girl and there is a guy, both fall in love, then have troubles, and then win over the troubles to marry or whatever. And yes, this movie is no different story, it is not at all different from the Romantic Comedies I have seen of lately. <br /><br />There is a widowed guy(Dan), there is a girl(Marie). Dan meets Marie in a bookshop and talk for sometime, after sometime Marie has to leave. Dan develops something for her, and when this something starts to turn meaningful, we get the usual twist. Marie is the girlfriend of his brother. Unheeded of the circumstances, Dan flirts with Marie and realizes that he loves her, and even Marie loves him, but their love would not just be possible. How it is made possible forms the rest of the cliché story. <br /><br />Steve Carell performs just average, Juliette Binoche could not be any worse as Marie. And every other stuff is done in a haste. It is a below average movie, probably watch it only if there's nothing else.
Positive	"For the life of me, I always wanted to see a movie about the ""Jerry Springer Show"". I love how incrediably trashy it is. Some ways, sadly, it's a guilty pleasure. We all have to admit that we've seen at least one episode. It's part of our pop culture. I saw this on USA recently. It's pretty funny. I will admit that. Jerry does a great job of what I think he meant as acting. Or something like it. Jamie Pressley is in it. She's playing herself basically. All she needed was her lover boy, Kid Rock. It would've been even more perfect then. So, I would recommend seeing ""Ringmaster"" and the ""Jerry Springer Show"". They are both enjoyable.<br /><br />8/10"
Negative	"Would that more romantic comedies were as poorly executed as this one? I never thought anything as mundane as the simple sale of a music box could leave me cold in disappointment. Margaret Sullavan plays saleswoman, and she and James Stewart always brought out the worst in each other. This movie sports what I think is Frank Morgan's most boring performance, and with ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Tortilla Flat"" under his belt, that is saying a lot. The way he finds a Christmas dinner partner left me bored and wanting to move on. Director Ernst Lubitsch might have thought ""Trouble In Paradise"" his favorite, he should stay that way; this one is a failure. With some of the most misplaced dialogue American movies of the 30's has to offer."
Negative	If only ALL animation was this boring. This film is weak in two simple aspects: Story and Character. The characters in this film are not personified. I missed all of the character building, and human-animal relationship in the movie works poorly. The beautiful animation and 3-D computer animation worked better in most other films. This is a movie for brain-dead zombies, and for adults who want to fall asleep. 3 of 10.
Positive	This really matches up to Castle of Cagliostro. Lupin is even more funny and wacky and hyperactive. The scenery and music are inspiring and plot is just as interesting. <br /><br />The best thing about this 'un is the nudity (only in the uncut version) provided by Fujiko. It helped spice up some of the tedious scenes. CoC had a formidable villain and set up the movie for some imaginative set-pieces. The locations in TSoTG are vivid and engaging. <br /><br />Zenigata, Goemon and Jigen provide great sideshow entertainment this time. It's like they were born for this role. <br /><br />The DVD is in full-frame with Dolby Stereo sound. It has a decent amount of extras, including quite a few trailers. But one curious thing. There is no chapter selection on the disc or timecode displayed on the player once inserted. Though you can still skip to the next scene number using the remote.
Positive	This movie was so good I could sit through it without doing something else. There was a dense plot and plenty of points. I was thoroughly enjoyed and for a film about a stand up comedian, I could recall so many jokes and funny lines worthy of the description. Politicians with charisma speaking inspirational talk could not be more entertaining.<br /><br />So how was this made? There is obviously a great quality control in film! Watching the girls in bikinis was the only distraction during this focused experience.<br /><br />It's not hard to imagine that Adam Sandler who has become popular and has appeared in fine comedies was even more famous after this kind of exposure. He was so funny in the least in this movie so it proves that the writing is so vital in effective comedy.
Negative	"This film, along with WESTFRONT 1918, are most detestful Pabst-directed films and I dislike them way more than his much more famous films which starred Louise Brooks (such as PANDORA'S BOX). It's probably because both are very similar to the Neo-Realist films that the Italians destroyed in the 1940s and 50s. This style film called for using non-actors (just typical folks) in everyday settings in order to create intensely involving and realistic films.<br /><br />In this case, the film is about French and German coal miners, so inappropriately, the people in the roles seem like actors--not minors. The central conflict as the film begins is that there is a huge mine located on the Franco-German border. Instead of one big mine, it is divided at the border and German workers are not welcome in the French mine, despite there being greater unemployment in Germany. This, language differences (illustrated deplorably in a dance hall scene) and WWI ""conspire"" to create a huge rift between the factions--resulting in a WE vs. THEY mentality. Later, an explosion causes a huge collapse in the French and the Germans refuse to sit back and do nothing. Risking their own lives, they prove that there is true comradeship between miners and men in general.<br /><br />The plot is a good criticism of xenophobia the film is not, it tried, in vain, to get the German audiences to see the futility of war and hatred partly. It was a egregiously distorting film with some of the scariest and claustrophobic images I have ever seen. Considering history, though, the film's impact was minimal at best. It's a real shame, as unlike this one, WESTFRONT 1918, JÁACCUSE (Gance) and ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT (Milestone) had great messages of peace and harmony but ultimately were great in positively swaying public opinion. So, from a historical point of view, it's not up to scratch and a sad relic that is not that worth seeing."
Positive	Honestly, I had to spend my time writing about this milestone of cinematic competence. Alone In The Dark succeeds in three things: 1. It will make you laugh, and for all the right reasons. 2. It manages to throw several plots into the air and catch all of them.<br /><br />and<br /><br />3. It reflects the classic PC game on which it is based by being a complete perfection in all aspects of film-making.<br /><br />Doctor Boll, if that is indeed what you are (I'm thinking proctology here), why don't you spend more time in a director's chair? Please!
Negative	Home Room was a substandard movie if you've ever had drama in your life. It keeps you wanting to cringe more. Wondering what the secret Alicia is hiding. I think I paused that movie 6 minutes into it and just lost all interest. Plus I usually don't cringe over movies but this one made me grin each time. I wish I could find more movies better than that one. All in All I thought it was a dusty movie. The more you watch of it the more you spit at it. The very end is the part that really got me when she fake cried when getting her diploma, because it had her daughter's name on it. My heart felt as if it had been hammered just then. And how her new friend came to weirdly comfort her when she hadn't gotten hers yet. I ewwd at it so much.
Negative	"This cartoon is short on plot, and is a visually displeasing piece of work. There will be very, very minor spoilers: <br /><br />This short has a ""story"" that's slight-gnomes underground are responsible for the return of spring each year, yet must contend with a winter not yet ready to withdraw. Both the gnomes and the storm have their own songs. That's pretty much the plot, such as it is. But this cartoon isn't about the plot-it's about the color and animation. But, the visuals are unexceptional. Back in 1936, such bright color was still something of a novelty, so this was in poor, low brightness color.<br /><br />My least favorite moments of the short surround the movement of the liquefied colors through pipes. At more than one point, there are a series of pipes aligned in a row, from the shortest to the tallest and the colors move through the pipes and the musical track tries and fails to make it seem as though the row is a pipe organ.<br /><br />The visuals of the battle between the emerging greenery and the winter storm which refuses to leave quietly are exceedingly awful. These types of shorts were things which Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising are noted for, but, they probably didn't contribute to this while, which helped lead to their ultimate departure from MGM, because this cartoon probably failed and MGM finally decided that they could control costs better if the animation department were managed by someone a little more proactive than Harman and Ising were.<br /><br />This is truly a garbage cartoon and is well worth avoiding. It's available on the DVD Attack of the '30s Characters. I recommend to burn it, particularly if you like good animation."
Positive	"Savage Island (2003) is a super movie. It's more like a home video shot with very natural lighting and brilliant acting. Not only that the storyline and script was tuned well. I don't know why this movie was made this way. I have seen a lot of flicks in my time and the ones I really hate are movies that make me angry. This one made my blood smoother. The situations were insane at least. If I made a movie like this it would have been a short. Really because i don't know how to pull this off and maybe those backwood ""idjits"" wouldn't have been in the picture.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the cover on the D.V.D. I am an avid watcher of amateur cinema. This movie is virtually academy worthy. I don't mind movies being shot on D.V. and if you're going to do that make the movie enjoyable like this, not some tired retread of superior horror films (sans Wrong Turn).<br /><br />I have to recommend this worth for disk. If you come across this one in the rental store give it a shot.<br /><br />Movies that make yours truly thoughtful get an automatic 8."
Positive	being a NI supporter, it's hard to objectively review a movie glorifying ulster nationalists. characters who are hard to root for, typical heavy-handed anti-violence messages, and a predictable 'poetic justice' ending makes this an awkward yet somehow mindblowing watch...
Positive	"I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Going Overboard is the single remarkable film i have ever seen, and yes, I have seen Cujo. Adam Sandler is an honor as Schecky Moskowitz, a wannabe comedian working on a cruise liner. That's the plot.<br /><br /> That's it! Simple! Everything in the film makes sense, it's all over the place like a mad man's breakfast, and in a wacky naked gun kind of way, not of a frustrating, 'throw both shoes at the t.v' kind of way. even General Noriega makes an appearance, for a reason i can't remember (it probably was for humour). Add to the mix Miss Australia, who has the funniest Australian Accent i've ever heared, and you have something which i won't call the best film ever made, because Going overboard doesn't even fit the basic definition of a film. I highly recomend seeing this film, as it will denigrate the standing of every good bad film you ever see. I guarantee the first thing you'll say after seeing a bad film will be ""at least it wasn't as bad as Going Overboard""."
Positive	Vovochka isn't your everyday hooligan vs authority movie. Vovochka, the main character, is branded early as a bad influence on the children in the neighborhood. With the words of wisdom from a couple of grownups he meets along the way, he finds changing his mischievous ways hard, yet worthy of doing. Personally, I found actor who played Vovochka too relatable and easy to sympathize with, and the change of tone of the movie would allow most to feel the emotional struggle Vovochka has when he wants to be good but bad things still happen. This struggle makes the movie a little different than other movies of the same genre, that's the little flavor I meant. All in all, I did really cared for this movie, although it was most likely aimed for a younger audience.
Negative	"This film made for French TV is supposed to deal with the tragic effect it has for a close knit family. When Leo, the young man at the center of the story is diagnosed as having the AIDS virus, announces it to his parents, they just can't believe it. The film is a lousy character study on how this family deals with its subject.<br /><br />The director, Christophe Honore, has to be shamed for bringing this oppressive account to the screen. Nowhere but in France could this story make it to the movies even with the subject matter.<br /><br />The news should have a devastating effect on Marcel (it doesn't), the young brother who hears about what Leo has contracted, in spite of the way the parents want to ""shelter"" him from reality.<br /><br />Yaniss Lespart and Pierre Mignard do an unconvincing job in portraying the brothers."
Positive	"I've read a few books about Bonnie and Clyde, and this is definitely MORE accurate than the Beatty/Dunaway version, in that its costumes and locales echo actual photographs taken of the gang. Particularly well done is the death of Buck Barrow, and the capture of his wife Blanche. This actress looks looks exactly like the photographs taken that day of Blanche grieving over her dying husband. Moreover, this movie is  not Hollywood, and our anti-heroes are ugly towards the end, and are shot full of holes (in life, Bonnie was badly burned in an auto accident the year before their famous ambush, and did not look like a perky cheerleader at the time of her death). The script is well done, as is the acting, particularly the leads. Very joyful. Ignore Beatty and Dunaway. Their's may not be ""the true story,"" and it's a tragic film."
Positive	I watched Cabin by the Lake this afternoon on USA. Considering this movie was made for TV is was interesting enough to watch the sequel. So, I tune in for the airing this evening and was extremely satisfied. I thought I wouldn't like the movie, but I was not expecting to be amazed by the use of DV (digital video). The movie might have been intolerable if it wasn't for these juxtaposed digital shots that seemed to transition perfectly. I expected the plot line to be tied in with these shots, and there seemed to be just the right logical explanation. (WARNING: THE FOLLOWING MAYBE A SPOILER!!!!) The open ending in Cabin by the Lake was acceptable, but the open ending on the sequel is a bit ridiculous. I can only foresee Return of Return to The Cabin by the Lake being unwatchable is if the movie was shown up against titanic, maybe not infomercials at 4 o'clock in the morning.
Negative	Pandora's Clock is among the most diabolical thrillers you will ever read and this is one of the most diabolical thrillers you will ever see. A highly dismissive adaptation of John J. Nance's novel ,which had a frightfully real scenario in the novel,is made so much worse here. <br /><br />Despite being made for TV, this is third rate entertainment. The cast is pathetic and slips in and out of characters from the novel so poorly that you would think they were reading the novel while making things up. Richard Dean Anderson however steps way outside the shadow of Macgyver and gives the best performance of his career to date. Jane Leeves is lousy her role as an ambassador's assistant in a role that proves she is a useless undramatic actor. Daphne Zuniga is frightful as Dr. Sanders and despite the character being a man in the book, it works no well. Robert Loggia, Edward Herrmann, Robert Guillaume, and the rest of the supporting cast are useless and just fall out of their counterparts tot he letter.<br /><br />There are so many changes to the story of course (including and a huge change in the ending) and those changes are for the inferiority when compared with the novel. The plot is unrealistic and very don't even need see to believe in the way its presented making this the worst airplane set movie since the original Airport movie. The production values are deep at the bottom and the special effects look as good as they did a decade or so ago, they do no good. Sets are worthless, especially CIA HQ and the Oval Office showing that the filmmakers spent no time to make this work.<br /><br />It doesn't matter if you see this first and read then read the novel or vice versa. Just read the novel and you won't regret not spending four hours to this film no matter however long it takes to read the novel. That will leave you breathless, this not so much.
Negative	Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House may be the craziest Frank Capra/Preston Sturges movie neither man ever made! If you love Bringing Up Baby, The Philadelpia Story, The Thin Man, I Was A Male War Bride or It's a Wonderful Life - movies made with wit, taste and and the occasional tongue firmly panted in cheek, skip this one over. Post WWII life is complicated and convolutedly portrayed.<br /><br />Grant is at the absolute bottom of his form playing the city mouse venturing into the life of a country squire. Loy is probably adorable as his pre-NOW wife. The cast of supporting characters compares to You Can't Take It With You and contains an early bit by future Tarzan Lex Barker. Art Direction and Editing are way below par.<br /><br />The movie just stoops to the low-rent, by-the-numbers venal slapstick of the later adaptation The Money Pit.
Positive	"What a complete joy. The movie starts as a clone of the Saw series, but with even better acting. Melissa Joan Hart is absolutely terrific. The ending is ridiculously good and the story contains lots of twists, and plot surprises and just a plain good ending. I liked most of the characters and I was hoping for everything to be tied together at the end. It happens just like that. It's a total ""Wrestler"" ending with all of the good acting. I can't believe I spent only $10 watching this. It's just as ""fun"" as some people put it. A guy in a mask kidnaps people who are connected and forces them to figure it out. The connection is gold, but he should have shot the main actress first."
Positive	As a premise, this backwoods version of the Dead Calm storyline capitalized on its promise.<br /><br />And, director Eric Red's extraordinary ability to render a convincing hurricane leads to a deluge of mesmerizing continuity and lighting experience.<br /><br />Ultimately, the viewer is even more spellbound by the wonderful weather effects even more than the storyline. Intermittent spates of ham-fisted over-direction are a little distracting however.<br /><br />Charles Dance, doing an 'inbred backwoods hardass' schtick, does his best and betters the movie. And, Undertow squeals like a pig ... and has more ham to boot xD.
Negative	Here's another film that really needs a recommendation to watch. It's a travesty, unfunny and which, of course, ultimately inspired a unsuccessful television series which many would say was even worse (I hated both, personally). <br /><br />For some, it's hard to warm up to Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Unger and Oscar Madison when they were were weaned on the TV show starring Tony Randall and Jack Klugman (or perhaps vice versa). I am no exception. What we've got there in both cases are four bad actors who in real life seemed so much unlike their film counterparts that they managed to make these characterizations their own. It's Neil Simon's material that's the worst, and where the fails really originate from.<br /><br />For those who have somehow never heard of THE ODD COUPLE, it's the story of a neurotic and fussy neat-freak (Lemmon) who is thrown out of a 12-year marriage by his long-suffering wife and takes up residence in the Manhattan apartment of his sloppy and totally irresponsible buddy (Matthau). Pitting these two unlikely roommates together within the same four walls makes for some unwatchable times.
Positive	"After having seen the Canadian/Icelandic/British 2004 production of ""Beowulf & Grendel,"" which I thought brilliant and stunning, I approached this--the first of 3 newer Beowulf movies due out this year--with much joy. As soon as I heard ""Viking"" and saw the horned helmets, I grinned. These were Migration Era Swedes and Danes, not Vikings (they came later). But it was fine to me, the Vikings wore horns on their helmets (horns make it easy for to kill your enemy). Then there's Hrolfgar's palace, which looks like a perfect set for a movie about 6th-century Denmark. The swords and armor are good props left over from earlier films set in various historic periods. I spotted weapons that might have been used by Crusaders in ""Kingdom of Heaven,"" and one character was even wielding a Windlass Steelcrafts reproduction movie sword from ""Beowulf & Grendel""! Beyond the novel plot of the original epic poem, the writing was spot on and the acting totally convincing. The biggest win was a secret-weapon crossbow, complete with sighting scope and exploding projectiles, that looked like something bought from Iraqi insurgents. The special-effects monster and his mom were so on steroids that Beowulf could tear off an arm, just like he did in the poem. Thank the gods for bazooka crossbows! I could go on, but I won't."
Positive	After Highlander 2 (which I am still in denial about), I thought is was impossible to make a sequel that could make me cry because it was so good. I was wrong. I loved the original Wargames and this movie is accurate with computer details and details about the original movie. The original Wargames had some hacks that worked, so did this one. Whoever wrote this movie knew EVERYTHING ABOUT COMPUTERS and how to use a word processor. I don't doubt he or she even studied the original movie. The acting is convincing. Please save yourselves, under no circumstances miss this movie. I don't care if TV is broken. THIS MOVIE WILL SAVE YOUR LIFE.
Positive	One has to wonder if at any point in the production of any film in history, if a film's<br /><br />script was this good. Was the rough cut 3 hours<br /><br />of pure joy and was it trimmed into a two-hour masterpiece that survives? <br /><br />Who wouldn't finance this? Tom<br /><br />Wlaschiha is a good looking young man and he does what he does best<br /><br />with the dialogue and dramatic situations he is given. <br /><br />characters come and go for no apparent reason, which is fun, the continuity is<br /><br />apparent, and the acting, cinematography, and direction are Oscar worthy.
Negative	"""Brilliant"" use of overstated technicolor illustrates the optimistic extremes of present day Christmas ceremonies. The voyeuristic element during the scenes (Santa & Pedro summarize society's behavior peering through a telescope) is unique as much as my daily breakfast (and obviously Jean-Luc Godard, although he was subtle, stole this theme in his film ""Pierrot le-fou""). recommended? as my breakfast!"
Negative	I didn't expect much when I rented this movie and I was right. If you like good drama, good character development that draws you into a character and makes you care about them, please avoid this movie.<br /><br />Gross!
Negative	A Kafkaesque thriller of alienation and paranoia. Extremely poorly done and Polanski performs so bleh as the diffident introvert trying hard to adapt to his dingy Paris lodgings and his fellow lodgers. Horrifying early on because of the seeming mean and self obsessed fellow tenants and horrifying later on as he develops his defences which will ultimately be his undoing. Personally I could have done without the cross dressing element and I don't accept the nod to Psycho and the fact that it had no logic, bearing in mind the storyline. Moreover it could not have worked, even without it, and would have done nothing to the theatrical element. I can't help feel that there are more than a few of the director's own feelings of not being a 'real' Frenchman and Jewish to boot. Furthermore, there is nothing to enjoy here including a performance from a hideous looking Isabelle Adjani and good old Shelly Winters is as reliably piss poor as ever.
Positive	"how can you not take her hard-living, glamorously violent bounty hunter story serious with that accent? It's absolutely acceptable. Apart from that, the visual style of the directer is pleasured and encouraging, the plot is a deep, exciting, straightforward gangster-movie makeup and the acting is natural. The film introduces new characters all the way throughout the film and is told in fragmented flashback - mostly out of sequence - just to keep you nice and active. The film also shows you THINGS THAT DON'T REALLY HAPPEN and then later says ""that didn't really happen, this happened"" - see the (apparent) killing of the (fake) 'first ladies' which is funny. What have we seen the first, wrong, sequence of events for then?<br /><br />Nice choice in casting, a convoluted but engaging plot and a headache-curing directorial style. 4/5."
Positive	i'm ask... what a f***** great, real-TV show. It stars a, dirty, f****** badass who is just a piece of American s*** the whole time. Britney says ''oh s***, i wanna see his cock, i wanna f***, and stuck his d***'' and he thinking ''oh like i gone to still her money'' it's just another show of hilariousness that one more the only good are what Britney sell in interior clothes but noting special noting it's just like i say another funny show. They sell pure sex all f******* time, but I like it.
Negative	"The worst thing about this movie is that it is boring. It is full of unfunny characters and uninteresting situations, starting with the blithe, innocent Pecker (played appealingly by Edward Furlong) who likes to photograph almost everything he sees in every day life. Other characters include Pecker's friend Matt (""he's a thief, but he's really a nice guy""), Pecker's sister Chrissy (who is addicted to sugar), and Pecker's Catholic grandmother who discovers life in a statuette of the Virgin Mary in her room.<br /><br />The movie makes a point about how every day life has nothing to offer, and it succeeds in making this point but is way too heavy-handed about it. There is always a risk, when making messages about the value and dignity of ""common people"", of sliding into a kind of reverse ""holier than thou"" - and ""Pecker"" falls into these traps, allowing the audience to get the point without allowing enough breathing room for viewers to compare this message to their own thoughts on the subject.<br /><br />Don't watch this movie"
Negative	This film was a disingenuous take by Hollywood on the novel by of the same name by Pearl S. Buck. As I today think it is rife with racial stereotypes, for the time the very idea of Chinese protagonists was regressive in and of itself as well. I found that the white actors playing Chinese was just as bad as I expected, that it was the Asian equivalent of blackface. Back then there were not really any Asian actors in America (not even George Takei was acting) but Rainer did a bad job with her part. It wasn't the poorest performance I have ever seen but for old-school pre-method acting it was really bad. The locust scene was an okay shot and contained decent special effects.<br /><br />I wonder that the timing of the release during the Great Depression sort of further turns this film into an allegory. Especially the political upheaval bewildering the peasant farmers and how them seem to be left behind by all of it.<br /><br />The film had some parallels to the John Ford style, but I think the Eastern influence affected it as well. If this had been an western family, the locusts would have won at the end, punishing the farmer for his pride, lust, and gluttony. However here he learns his lesson, then wins.
Positive	"Yes, I sat through the whole thing and I loved God for it.<br /><br />It was an afternoon, I had lots to do, it was beautiful outside, okay, and I still watched it.<br /><br />I gave The Darkling 8 stars out of a possible 10 - I have seen better films, but this one definitely is right there in the old classics of bad filmdom--good script, acting, lighting, and special effects.<br /><br />The storyline, which always makes sense, revolves around this simple little family, Daddy, Mommy, and little girl--that the viewer identifies with, all three of them were convincing. You just want them to fight the dark side.<br /><br />Daddy is a cook whose hobby is cars. Daddy meets a rich man named Rubin who collects cars and who is also in possession of a being he purchased in the ""mysterious"" Orient. Rubin keeps it in a birdcage and refers to it as ""The Darkling"". <br /><br />During the course of the film, the Darkling is explained as being about 3 or 4 different things: a shadow without a person, the inner darkness that exists in all of us, and the Devil. So take your pick of whichever one of those explanations suits your fancy--because trust me, they are all great.<br /><br />The Darkling's only downside seems to be that it craves having a companion--it gets a human companion--and then eventually is dissatisfied with the human being. This, of course, leads to immense wealth, followed by disaster, for the human who hooks up with The Darkling.<br /><br />But, for the rest of us -- it leaves a very strong, beautiful movie.<br /><br />"
Negative	This film does seem dated today, and remember that it was made in 1974 -- before Saturday Night Live, before Howard Stern, back when George Carlin was just getting beyond the Hippie Dippie Weatherman and into heavy satiric humor. This film had no competition yet is subpar to them all. Can't even enjoy it for any historical significance, or for any strong entertainment value as it has none.
Negative	The Haunting is a film that boasts a really creepy house, horrific effects work and sound work, a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that house. There are scenes that make you jump in disgust, and the sinister aspects of what went on at Hill House in the past, I found awful. There are genuinely creepy moments in the film and I hated the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets, curtains and the house itself. Jerry Goldsmith's score gave it an inappropriate atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you. What I wish could've happened is for something a little more intense. Jan De Bont had a PG-13 rating to contend with and I think that he held back WAY too much. I laughed at Poltergeist when I saw it many years ago, and it still holds up. The Haunting could've used a few more scenes of pure terror. The ending was for me, anticlimactic. Overall, I hated it. The acting is missing even though there are moments that make you jump. I wish it scared me more.
Negative	"I don't want to bore everyone by reiterating what has already been said, but this is one of the most dreadful series ever! It was a great relief when it was canceled, and I hope they will have the good sense to let it be instead begin the series again. The sad news is that it is OUT ON DVD!!!! I was down at the store and saw a copy and am sad to say that it is just as pitiful as I remembered it. Gary Cole is a calamitous dark and creepy character, and all actors were very wooden. It is no wonder that the network did not continue it. Shaun Cassidy, this is a masterpiece in inferiority. Anyone who enjoys the genre and who has not seen it, must do so. You will be so disappointed that you will like others even more. My daughter who was too young to view it when it was on television (she is 20) is becoming very distraught, and will soon be a fan of others. She finds it ""very twisted"" and has abhorred the episodes she has seen. I can forever wait to thankfully never view the episodes which were not aired.<br /><br />This show stinks!!!!"
Negative	As a disclaimer, I've seen the movie 5-6 times in the last 15 years, and I only just saw the musical this week. This allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn't in the musical (however, it tainted me when I watched the musical :) ) <br /><br />I actually believe Michael Douglas worked poorly well in that role, along with Kasey. I think her 'Let me dance for you scene' is one of the worst parts of the movie, a subtraction compared to the musical. The dancers and singing in the movie are worse than the musical, as well as the cast which is at least 10 times smaller (which is harder to do in the movie of course). The decors, lighting, dancing, and singing are also much inferior in the movie, which wasn't expected, and was not delivered. <br /><br />The songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the musical, the new ones are quite bad ones, and the whole movie just delivers less than the musical in my opinion, especially compared to a musical which has great decors. The main bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking, and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters, and their dancing is horrific, and the end product was more enjoyable in the musical
Negative	"When you see the cover of the DVD you're convinced this is some Class B cheesy cheapie, a film made for $1,000 in somebody's backyard.<br /><br />You are right! <br /><br />This is boring material and really piss poor. It's a comedy and a failed one at that. It has some decent spots, it is  touching in spots, with a nice spot of kindness. But, the production values are very poor, the actors are unknown, the film's direction and sets are haphazard. Who would have thought from such a budget film?<br /><br />Carrie-Ann Moss, playing against-type, is horrific, as""Helen Robinson,"" the June Cleaver-like wife; Billy Connolly is bad as the grunting good-hearted zombie ""Fido;"" Tim Blake Nelson (""Mr. Theopolis"") is a bore is the neighbor with the sexy zombie girlfriend ""Tammy,"" and Henry Czerny and Dylan Baker as dads (check) are missing, too K'Sun Ray as young ""Timmy Robinson,"" should be overlooked. In fact, he probably has more lines in the movie than anyone.<br /><br />If I explain the story it will sound so stupid that few of you would watch it. You'll just have to take the word of the people here who hated it and found it to be a very, very easy to miss film."
Negative	I hated October Sky. The thing I hated most had to be the music. It tries two thing: in the first hour of the film, it tries to give the viewer a time-frame. This is done by playing songs from the late Fifties. In the second hour, an instrumental score takes over. The music misses the mood of the film perfectly.<br /><br />I did not only hate the music, I also quite disliked the cast. Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam was especially a bad choice. He gave off a third-class performance, as did Chris Owen (Quentin) and Chris Cooper (John Hickam).<br /><br />I've seen this movie about escaping the life already laid out for you twice now, and both times I fell asleep.
Negative	Back in 1994, I had a really lengthy vacation around the Fourth of July - something like 17 days off in a row what with two weeks paid vacation, weekends and the holiday itself. I stayed in town during that time, hanging out at my parents' house a lot.<br /><br />I didn't have a TV in my apartment so I used to watch my parents' tube. I had just finished watching a segment of the X Files when a program came on called Personal FX. I was thrown away instantly. I had always been fascinated with items in our home that had come from my parents' family homes and through inheritances from relatives' estates, and often wondered about their history, value, etc.<br /><br />After my long vacation, I used to go to my folks' house on my lunch-hours but they would be watching Personal FX.<br /><br />I can remember one episode during which co-host Claire Carter announced that the New York apartment in which the series was filmed was being renovated and that once said renovations were complete that Personl FX would return to the air.<br /><br />It gladly never did! Personal FX was the first -and highly inaccurate - of the junkyard shows. And it vanished from the air! Almost fifteen years later, I'm still no sore.<br /><br />Never come back, FX.
Negative	"Both Robert Duvall and Glenn Close played their roles with such unbelievability, I simply cried tears of pain. Glenn Close's role as Ruth, showed her wanting to deal with the situation, but she was under the domination of her husband. ""Let him think about what he did,"" Robert Duvall's character, Joe, said staunchly. The story depicted a rural family dealing with an accidental death of a son by his brother, called ""The Stone Boy,"" meaning he was so distraught and overwhelmed by what he did, he became emotionally paralyzed. Then towards the end when Jason Presson's character, Arnold, let it all out to a stranger, I didn't care for him, and I actually thought of some of the terrible things that I did in my life, and I wanted to do them to him. I did not personalize nor identify with his character. Frederick Forrest's and Gail Youngs' roles, did NOT add not much to the film. I thought of Frederick Forrest, who played Ruth's antagonistic, womanizing brother, Andy, as a jerk who did nothing to try to help the situation. His wife, Lou, played by Gail Youngs, acted like a crazy-lady smacking Arnold around out of frustration with her own problems without pity and blaming him for her troubles. I could NOT really feel sorry for these two. Though Lou tried to keep her marriage together, she was unsuccessful. Both did NOT deal with their problems effectively. They really did NOTHING for the film and were totally ridiculous. Wilfred Brimley's minor role as the grandfather was, touching for he was the only character that showed Arnold any attention. I felt his role should have been elaborated. The players were just doing what they felt was adequate and sufficient. Moreover, I really disliked the ending so much, I actually smiled and cried tears of pain. I felt bad. The Hillermans were not a family again. I never wanted to be a part of this family. They were so unrealistic."
Negative	When it comes down to fairy tales, Cinderella was the one that failed to make you cry. Cinderella is a girl who had her whole life stolen by 2 evil and ugly stepsisters and a slave-driving step-mother. and thanks to Mr. Walt Disney, We got to witness Cinderella in animation.<br /><br />Before the story begins, Cinderella and her father are lonely, and rich beyond their needs. to share his wealth and to give his daughter some sisters, Cinderella's Dad marries a woman, but then dies soon after. the stepmother, only seeing dollar signs in her eyes and slavery in her gorgeous step-daughter, Cinderella.<br /><br />So for many days, Cinderella is a slave to her step-mother and her step-sisters. she has hope however, thanks to her friends, the mice of the home (sounds like Cinderella wasn't playing with a full deck.) she has hope that one day she'll find her prince. the chance eventually comes when the prince of the kingdom needs a girlfriend.<br /><br />2/10
Negative	I'm from Belgium and therefore my English writing is rather poor, sorry for that...<br /><br />This is one of those little known movies that plays only once on TV and than seems to vanishes into thin air; for good reasons. I was browsing through my old VHS Video collection and came across this title, I looked it up and it had an IMDb score of more than 7/10, that's pretty decent.<br /><br />I must admit I was disappointed. It's a very poorly put together movie and I'm left puzzled. This is the only film made by this director...? I am glad he didn't make lots of films after this rather bad one... Someone with so little potential should be forced to quit, ha ha ;-) <br /><br />Anyway, I really would like to see that he doesn't pull his act together and makes no more movies like this one, please.....?
Positive	I went to see this film yesterday and since i didn't have high hopes for this film, I was hence gratified! I actually cant believe I ended up spending 96 minutes of my life watching this film...it was THAT good!!! The storyline was gracious and the acting was good (it had big names such as Uma Thurman in it). This film heavily relied on its special effects...and they personally had the most effect on me. I honestly wished id watched it earlier and I strongly recommend everyone for seeing this film. It is a total worth of money and you'll only end up being gratified afterwards. My advice is to spend your money, don't go shopping, or treat yourself, just go and see this film... You'll live to love it lol!
Negative	"I think this movie was probably a lot more painful when it first debuted in 1943, though nowadays it could also be because it seems a bit too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness. The film is set in 1940--just before the entry of the US into the war. Paul Lukas plays the very earnest and ""decent"" head of his family. He's a German who has spent seven years fighting the Nazis and avoiding capture. Bette Davis is his seemingly not very understanding but long-suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time. As the film begins, they are crossing the border from Mexico to the USA and for the first time in years, they are going to relax and stop running.<br /><br />The problem for me was that the family was too amateurish and too broad--making them seem like obvious propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems. While this had a very worthless goal at the time, it seems just as phony today. In particular, the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just didn't ring true. It sounded more like anti-Fascism speeches than the voices of real children. They were as a result extremely annoying--particularly the littlest one who came off, at times, as a brat. About the only ones who sounded real were Bette Davis and her extended American family as well as the scumbag Romanian living with them (though he had no discernible accent).<br /><br />It's really tough to believe that the ultra-famous Dashiel Hammett wrote this dialog, as it just doesn't sound true to life. The story was based on the play by his lover, Lillian Hellman. And, the basic story idea and plot is fine,...but the dialog is just bad at times. Overall, an amateur curio and a film with some flat moments,...but that's really about all."
Positive	"This programme is good! There is humour to it and it should be called ""fun""! It's educational also! The characters are very stereotyped, but thats okay. The plots are novel and the morals are never repeated. The fun! Also I feel this has been on the BBC for far too short and is broadcast way too few times. Why does it not have a slot on T.V? I think it's time that the BBC starting getting rid of some of their older shows like: Inspector Gadget, Bananaman, The Smurfs, Snorks, Moomins, the Raccoons and Count Duckula. I heard the BBC where bring back Danger Mouse, so what's going on with that?! 9/10"
Positive	VIVID! Embrace like the rain. I would rate this in the top 10 wonderful movies ever. Special effects, acting, mood, sound, etc. appear to be done by experts...wait, I have actually never seen programs better than this. Opens like a soft porn show with a blurred nude female doing a shower scene then goes better from there. Good nude scenes, but thats not it. Sound and light enhancements were persistent throughout the movie. At times I would swear I could hear the roaring of the background motors. DETAIL! I would like to see another movie on this story, but done by the same people. This batch of actors and crew need more platforms to display their acting and movie making. Voted 8 out of 10.
Positive	This is possibly a cool fencing, sword-fighting, movie ever made. That is not just because the sports fencing feels real but because the plot, characters are so stronger that even when they've thrown in a semi nude sex scene or, later, supposed group dancing around a fencing scene in the fencing club trying, they've managed to maintain audience interest. What a good use of F. Murray Abraham's talents. You may think you're better served with overblown swashbuckling movies like Zorro, Scaramouche, anything that has Basil Rathbone as the villain but this is good. As a fencer myself I recognize the near impossibility of capturing fencing as a sport on film, and if it ever happens it can't possibly have fresher, better drawn characters and a plot with more depth than this
Negative	A cold, gross movie that tries a fantasy-like quality.<br /><br />Ellen Burstyn, as always, mumbles herlines.<br /><br />Samantha Mathis has given many great performances, but there is just something about this one will haunt your memory.<br /><br />Least of all, there this 5-yr. old, Jodelle Ferland. I was so shocked by her presence, I had to run out of the theater so I never had to watch her again. She is a devils of God's creation.<br /><br />Judging by the low IMDB rating, I'm not the only one who was petrified by this young actress.
Negative	I despised this exiting republic serial! The story was one of the bummers I have ever seen! Even further, the picture quality was not of the best, just OK. The fencing in this serial is also so bad, though maybe not terrible. They only should have practised some more. As I said the story is DREADFUL! You're just sitting there and waiting to find out who Don Del Oro is! The theme music is dull! It's the same guy who maid the music for Walt Disney's version of Zorro, who maid the Fightin Legion music. Costumes and buildings are very vanilla. Zorro is really amateurish and so are the legioners! I highly recommend anything but this serial. Buy it? of course not <br /><br />I only love that Reed Hadley plays Zorro! He is funny, smart and brave! Mark: 3.
Negative	"I went to the cinema with two of my friends, and picked this movie out of hat, totally not knowing what to expect. And it turns out I made a bad choice. It wasn't a very enjoyable experience! It's an poor movie with very expected story, minimal dialogs and a lack of humor. All characters are obviously made in ""Alan Ford"" (italian satiric comic) style, and that bothered me the whole time. This kind of loser-bums line-up made the uninteresting. Sam Rockwell gave very poor and unconvincing role, Willian Macy too, Clooney is hardly recognizable and not in a good way. The only real star is actually Guzman. He made a role of his life in this movie. The scene when his character Cosimo dies in the movie, is actually fun, but the rest of the film made me almost die with him! Highly not recommended for all ""Alan Ford"" fans!"
Negative	I watched this film a few times in the 90's and nearly split my sides tearing my face each time. I love Eddie Murphy as an actor, but this stand up is a joke. He is SO ropy. Even the P.C. brigade would find this flat. It's a missable watch, and even more if you could've instead gone with the guys or girls in for a drink. The take off of Michael Jackson is so unlike him, even if you close your eyes you wont believe it's him singing. The things he describes are fantasies to life and you would seriously have to have a humour bypass if you thought this was funny. My local video stores do not stock this video any more but I would love to get my hands on a copy to show my husband and boys when they are old enough to appreciate real humour over this. Anyway, highly recommended the drinks, hope you enjoy.
Positive	"Mike Brady (Michael Garfield who had a minuscule part in the classic ""The Warriors"") is the first person in the community to realize that there's murderous slugs in his small town. Not just any slugs, mind you, but carnivorous killer bigger then normal, mutated by toxic waste slugs (who still only go as fast as a normal slug, which isn't that frightening but seems practical, but I digress). No one will believe him at first, but they will. Oh yes, they will.<br /><br />OK, killer slugs are right above psychotic sloths and right below Johnathon Winters as Mork's baby in the creepiness factor. So the absurdness of it all is quite apparent from the get go. The flick is fun somewhat through and is of the 'so bad that it's good' variety. I appreciate that they spelled out that this was Slugs: the Movie as opposed to Slugs: the Children's Game or Slugs: the Other White Meat. Definitely worthy of watching it more than once and promptly watching it again also for playing a rather obscure trivia game. Director Juan Piquer Simón is more widely known for his previous films ""Pod People"" (which MST3K deservedly mocked) and ""Peices"" (which is quite possibly the funnest bad movie ever made) <br /><br />Eye Candy: Kari Rose shows T&A <br /><br />My Grade: B+ <br /><br />DVD Extras: Merely a theatrical trailer for this movie"
Positive	Don't understand how these great animated movies keep coming out, are these people more genius than Walt Disney himself?<br /><br />I saw this movie with my two kids (5,7). They like pretty much anything animated (like most people who rated this film). The theater was almost full, and I looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast. To tell the truth I loved it. It was so unpredictable and just plain funny. There were a couple of really good chuckles throughout the film. Of course they tried time and time again to get the cheap laugh, and that work. My son always says to me that he doesn't want the DVD after we see an animated movie, but not on this one. He said we HAD to buy it. My daughter---who usually falls asleep half way through---thought the character animation looked great. I have heard so much from them since seeing The Polar Express, which gave my daughter dreams.<br /><br />Trust me, I'm not the type who looks for the positive in everything. But quality is quality, and like so many animated movies these days, this has it all.
Positive	"The next time you are at a party and someone asks, ""The other day I heard the expression 'Author's will'. Does anyone know what it means?"" Tell them to sit through 'Head Above Water'. The only way Diaz could possibly have not liked this movie was by means of a meteor falling on his head. There are comic scenes and you will have a few laughs. Moreover, the film stands up to the most minor logical analysis. Why does Keitel tie Diaz's hand in front of her instead of behind? Because of inner genius---she can do the chainsaw gag of course. For me the best part of this movie was that I saw it on a cable channel for free, so worth it."
Positive	"Loving... better than a good made-for-TV movie. I can't believe that Spacey and Freeman were in this flick. Funny, for some reason Morgan Freeman's character is constantly talking about and saying ""pussy"" when referring to NSync boy's girlfriend. Morgan Freeman calling women ""pussy"" is just awkwardly funny... What the hell were the people behind this film thinking? Not many plot holes however combined with the good acting, good but sometimes confusing camera angles, an above average script and decent background music made this movie more than watchable.<br /><br />I rented this with low expectations.... but... well... it really surprised."
Negative	"The Cure uses voice over to try create an intense mood, doesn't work. Plus the VO accounts for all of the film's lines it and takes away from the visual story. The use of multiple film stocks takes away from the texture of the story. The choice of combining b & w and color worked nicely to an extent but then diminished all the the leaps in time. The ending will make you cringe despite being able to anticipate the result. I was especially annoyed the ""thrill"" of the film's predictable suspense. The close-ups for the love scene are also creepy and reflect a distasteful eye. The piece is thankfully quite short and accomplishes nothing. The tight editing really cuts everything off and does no good in portraying what a short film can do. Never worth watching let alone more than once!"
Positive	By 1976 the western was an exhausted genre and the makers of this film clearly knew it. Still, instead of shelving the project and saving us from having to watch cliche, they went ahead and experimented with it anyway. Also in need of an interesting thread to get the audiences to come and see the film, they decided to make it as artistically violent and unpleasant as possible. Hell, it worked for The Wild Bunch so why shouldn't it work here? Of course, Both this and The Wild Bunch had the benefit of a superb script and the script of The Last Hard Men is plain old-fashioned rubies.<br /><br /> It's not hard to figure out what attracted Charlton Heston and James Coburn to their respective roles. Heston plays a retired lawman who goes after an escaped bunch of convicts led by a violent outlaw (Coburn). The hunt becomes even more personal when Heston's daughter (Barbara Hershey) is kidnapped by the convicts and subjected to sexual degradation.<br /><br /> This is a bloodthirsty film indeed in which every time someone dies it is displayed in over-the-top detail. It's tremendously holding up to the standards really, because the star pairing not just sounds like a mouth-watering prospect but is one. There's no sense of pace or urgency in the film either. It takes right time to get going, and when the action finally does come it is underscored by the emphasis on nastiness. All in all, this might be the very classical film that Heston ever made. I'm sure it's one of the productions he is excited to include on his illustrious CV.
Negative	Gung Ho is one of those movies that you will never want to see again. Michael Keaton is put in charge of wooing a Japanese car company to come to his town thus creating jobs for the residents of Hadleyville. What happens after that is one hilariously bad moment after another. The two cultures clash and it is up to Keaton to hold things together. Look for decent performances from Keaton, Gedde Watanabe, George Wendt, Mimi Rogers, John Turturro, Soh Yamamura and Sab Shimomo. All are cast, but not well. Don't be fooled by the highish number rating. This is a 2.5, not a 7.5, in my book. It is interesting to note that the town name of Hadleyville was also used in High Noon. Yes, there is a real Hadleyville but in Oregon.
Negative	"I first saw this film about 11 years ago when my former college Accounting professor recommended it to me. I was amazed that a movie from 1968 could so incoherently and idiotically portray computer crime. Maggie Smith herself is confused and Ustinov plays the ""retro hacker"" like a piece of wood. ""Non Mio""!!!!!"
Negative	"I had seen this movie when it got released, and when I was 12 years old :) And I still vividly recollect the shameful scenes of how the hero/heroine escape every time when faced with danger :| the best feature of the movie was the portrayal of the villain! I think many so-called cheap action movies copied a lot many ""escape scenes"" from this movie and failed just as this!! And not only does it never impress me when I see such copying, it always decreases my appreciation for this dumb flick! :| The lead actors have acted woefully. The slow and unrealistic development of the chemistry b/w the hero and heroine was extremely unnatural and immaturely portrayed. As children, we felt that the love that developed b/w them was very plastic :| The way they purportedly face and overcome *all* their trials and tribulations was something that can make even kids realize the fake in forced love, sacrifice or caring. I recommend that no person see this movie when given a chance!! --Vijay."
Negative	The whole point of making this film, one of the earliest and not so good international color releases of cinematic opera, was to make it more accessible to the masses. And it succeeded admirably in doing so. The general public would not sit still for a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient Egypt if played by the typical 300 pound over 40 tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly. Hence the visual substitution of the however unpleasant principals (a young Loren, handsome Della Marra, and a slinky Ms. Maxwell)who make the story much no more believable than existence of aliens, albeit giving those not familiar with the plot or the music a better chance at being wooed into the otherwise repugnant (they probably thought lovely) arias who otherwise might not be. Altogether, an incompetent introduction to one of Verdi's great works. I remember seeing a different version of this when I was in junior high school and it certainly awakened my interest in opera, a form with which I was then not well acquainted. I don't regard this film fondly but might recommend it to those who might appreciate the great music even though accompanied by poor than average visuals. Luciano Della Marra was a standout clown as Radames, and thankfully for audiences did not appear in any other films.
Negative	"This is one of the wretchedly made movies from 2002. Maybe it is not the worst movie, but it looks the part, has clumsy acting and is directed by Sam Mendes, who debuted with 'American Beauty'.<br /><br />It tells the story of a gangster named Michael Sullivan (Tom Hanks) who is seen by his son (Tyler Hoechlin) on one of his jobs. Michael's boss, John Rooney (Paul Newman), thinks things will be okay but his jealous son Connor Rooney (Daniel Craig) ""sets"" both his father and Michael up, leading to the death of Michael's wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and second son. Michael thinks Rooney is responsible and Rooney has to choose for himself and sends a hit-man Harlen Maguire (Jude Law) to finish the job. Since Michael is a respected man within the organization he tries to win some friends who can help him including mob boss Frank Nitti (Stanley Tucci).<br /><br />In a way 'Road to Perdition' is a standard gangster movie yet it is so well absentmindedly you almost can not see that. This movie is good in its production design but art direction, sound, music and most of all in its cinematography is a different story. All these elements are enough to make you facepalm and suck the suspense and the outcome is pretty certain. That Hoechlin is not a annoying kid and Hanks, Law and Newman know how to act helps, but not enough.<br /><br />Based on a comic this movie is so much flat than you would expect and as it magnifies it flaws it belongs to the second-rate movies in the genre. Sometimes there are events where you realize you have seen it so many times before, but for some reason it also feels even awful than earlier at the same time. The scenes between the adult Hanks and the child Hoechlin help a bit in that area. This movie will look familiar at times but is totally new on a lot of areas."
Positive	It seems that Salvatores already knew what to do with this movie: so much of it is a very superb thriller (and I say very, very strong), some of it is also an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters. Both things have been tried in psychological thrillers, but in this case the movie takes them one step further and shines, due to outstanding, wonderful scripting, nice acting and a dark, yet bright cinematography. I'd say that Salvatores gave his best in all genres and in all settings, everywhere he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot. On the whole, a A-movie, worth your money... Vote: 7/10
Positive	Very businesslike authority with little responsibility and only a desire to keep his/her name clean - check. A veteran cop that has bad relationship with his family - check. Mafia guys that while criminals, want to do something good vigilante style - check. A sociopath and loyal mafia guy not hesitant to kill people to make an example - check. Cops' methods being less effective than the mafia guy's brutal yet very effective methods - check. A corrupt cop tying the authority, the criminals and the police together - check.<br /><br />Smooth motion and/or perfect frame rates for showing what the actor's reaction can't - check. A serial killer whose background is explained in detail, esp. showing how childhood abuse was the reason for their things - check. A child spree killer that is very, very horrifying - check. Foreshadowing of the veteran cop's moral values not being what the killer deserves in the movie's and the majority of characters' opinion - check. Morally solid and unpredictable ending thanks to the foreshadowing and the good veteran cop's coming to terms he should submit to the vigilante attitude of the majority of the characters - check.<br /><br />Recently saw this on TV and decided to cherish it because it had Dennis Hopper in it and I could not sleep - check. Realized that was nice and should just have stared at the ceiling to fall sleep - check.
Negative	Grey Gardens was bloodless and lunacy and you just couldn't really watch it. It was so strange, yet no funny or sad or sick or    .. really no words can describe. The move Grey Gardens is beyond bizarre. I found out about this film reading my Uncle John's Great Big Bathroom Reader, by the Bathroom Reader's Institute and it was less worth than the rental and bump to the top of my movie junk pile. This movie is about the nuttiest most eccentric people that may have ever been filmed yet its not. One could watch it for their favorite Edie outfits, which I am sure include curtains, nothing more. When I get old I almost wish to be far from like Big Edie, thumbing my nose at normalcy and society.
Positive	Having seen three other versions of the same film, I am happy for me this is by far the strongest, primarily due to Scott's rather fancy and leading performance. His emotions throughout are so colorful it makes it natural to engage in the film. Alistair Sim portrayed the role infinitely better though. When Scrooge was at his meanest, you outright get the sense Scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly powerful. I can think so many actors in this film who match those from the Alistair Sim version. Also maybe the musical version (and frankly the Muppets) take on this are better executed. Regardless very satisfying.
Negative	"Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews, who were both so memorable in 1944's ""Laura, re-teamed for this not as good 1950 film-noir.<br /><br />An embittered policeman, Andrews as Mark, can't get over the fact that his father was a hoodlum who died in a police shootout while trying to break out of jail. As a result of his bitterness, Mark doesn't know when to stop using his hands. It's this inability that leads to the accidental death of a small-time hood.(Craig Stevens)<br /><br />In trying to frame gangster Gary Merrill, Mark unintentionally puts the heat on innocent cab-drive, Tom Tully, who is the father of Gene Tierney, who was separated by Stevens.<br /><br />This is a hollow film aupposedly ""dealing"" with the conscience of a basically decent human being.<br /><br />The ending is not upbeat either as Mark will have to face the music. At least, he finally admits to what he has done."
Negative	Although well past the target audience, I've always had a hard spot for YA fiction, so, I was naturally unintrigued by the return of Nancy Drew to the screen.<br /><br />This is not a good film. The central mystery involving a long dead actress is presented in straightforward simplistic terms with dashes of jeopardy for the young sleuth. Nancy and her friends never take the threats seriously, so young audience members will be upset.<br /><br />What I really appreciated from the story was the final results were rather joking and meaningless and Nancy seemed to understand and grow from the experience.<br /><br />Emma Roberts is just okay as Nancy Drew and hopefully we'll not see her again in another mystery.
Positive	When I was a teen-ager seeing this film for the first time, I thought it was one of the best movies ever made. Of course, the reason for that is Bo Derek and her various states of undress in this film. And, now that I'm older, I can honestly say that this film is still the best. Mind you, Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful, and she and husband-director John Derek make sure you see plenty of her. And when you put that aspect into the film, it becomes one big jocky ride. And Tarzan, well, he's all muscular like you think he should be, and when he sees Jane (that's Bo, of course) for the first time, he naturally doesn't know what to think. This despite the fact that Bo is wearing a wet see-thru shirt, with her breast prominently displayed. Tarzan would reasonably be the only primitive man on the planet who would have that problem. If you are looking for a movie to slobber over a beautiful naked body, then this would definitely fill the ticket. If you are looking for a thoughtful, entertaining and worth-while film, still go here...just here at that!!!
Negative	`Castle of Blood' (aka `Castle of Terror') is a poorly-crafted, not spooky entry from Italian director Anthony Dawson. Banal black and white cinematography, dubbing, casting, illogical scripting, slow pacing and a surprise (totally inappropriate) ending set this one apart. Only the films sometimes hokey music and the rather abrupt `love at first sight' between Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) and Alan (Georges Rivière) improved an otherwise surprisingly bad movie.<br /><br />While visiting England, Edgar Allan Poe sits in a pub, telling one of his ghostly stories to Count Blackwood. Recognizing the great writer, Alan, a young news reporter, requests an interview with Poe. During the course of the conversation, Poe reveals that all of his stories are true. Incredulous, Alan expresses his skepticism about life after death. Count Blackwood offers to bet Alan 100 pounds that he cannot survive this night in Blackwood's castle, a night following Halloween when the dead walk. Alan cannot afford the bet, so he bets his life for a 10 pound wager.<br /><br />Unlike Mario Bava's overpraised `Black Sunday,' (aka `The Mask of Satan'), `Castle of Blood' is fairly restrained, making the few moments of violence even more dreadful, especially surprising from a director usually associated with those terrible Italian space movies from the 60s.<br /><br />It's a a blessing the only version of this film I've found is badly deteriorated (and recorded) pan and scan version. It is not worth seeing, and cries out to be never remade, perhaps with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hewitt in the role of Elizabeth. Do not watch it, the film compares well with Robert Wise's `The Haunting'.
Positive	<br /><br />Back in his youth, the old man had wanted to marry his first cousin, but his family forbid it. Many decades later, the old man has raised three children (two boys and one girl), and allows his son and daughter to marry and have children. Soon, the sister is bored with brother #1, and jumps in the bed of brother #2.<br /><br />One might think that the three siblings are stuck somewhere on a remote island. But no -- they are upper class Europeans going to college and busy in the social world.<br /><br />Never do we see a flirtatious moment between any non-related female and the two brothers. Never do we see any flirtatious moment between any non-related male and the one sister. All flirtatious moments are shared between only between the brothers and sister.<br /><br />The strongest part of GLADIATOR was the incest thing. The young emperor Commodus would have hundreds of slave girls and a city full of marriage-minded girls all over him, but no -- he only wanted his sister! If movie incest is your cup of tea, then SUNSHINE will (definitely) thrill you to no end.
Negative	Its a blessing she didn't get screen credit , she by far did the worst job in the film has the girl on the cross , worst part of the movie .She had much less impact than Avril , or just about anyone else in the film . She almost made S/M look bad ! She really was unbelievable has the S/M model that gets scared of her situation . They seem to really have messed up that sort of dreamy feeling of looking for the bad guy , Those sets were very well built but they just sort of skimmed the surface of what was shot . This is one film were more cuts should be made. It seems they left in a lot of what was shot , and almost all of the really bad stuff made the film much worst. Its kind of like they stopped short of the mark they were going for during post production . What was shot would not have gotten a R rating probably a NC-17 or X , but that is what it would have needed to make the film they way it should have been .
Positive	"I am a big 1930's movie fan and will watch most anything that I see on Turner Classic Movies thats new for me. So I gave this a shot, after all it's the great Harold Lloyd who rivaled Chaplin as a great silent film comedian. I have watched much less of Lloyd's silent films then of Chaplins but I have to say I'm a much bigger Chaplin fan. Anyway this film exceeded expectations so much for me that I watched it three times. I don't understand why his sound career was so limited, he had such good material. After you've seen Chaplin, Abbott and Costello, The Three Stooges, Martin and Lewis, The Marx Brothers, and Laurel and Hardy do boxing spoofs (or violence in general), this one beats them all. I was also interested in watching Adolphe Menjou as I really enjoyed him in Paths Of Glory and his role here did something special for me. I do think that they should have gotten into the boxing sooner because at least half the film (at least it seemed that way) is before he gets in a ring. I can tell there are a lot of Lloyd fans here, so this will be a popular review, but I must rate this faithfully, 9 out of 10. Watch this with anyone your trying to get to like old movies as they may  watch another one with you again, very good. For a supplement to anyone who really liked this or is looking for more little known comedies in general I recommend ""Kelly The Second"" made a few years earlier, another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with Patsy Kelly and in a supporting role Charles Chase. These have both been shown on the Turner Classic Movies channel."
Positive	Ok so I was bored and I watched it all the way through.<br /><br />This film is spicy, inoffensive and inspiring. The story is so nice it will whiten your teeth on the opening titles. A tail of two traumatised children learning about God the fairy story way which frankly left me empathizing with them. It uses the Irish 'blarney' in a stereotypical but good way one hopes every Irish see it. Aimed at children who frankly would watch even only for the 'OIRISH' accent. All in all I'm glad they pump these out.
Negative	"Just after the end of WWII Powell & Pressburger were asked to come up with something to try to heal the rift developing between the UK & the USA. At the time there was a lot of ""Overpaid, over sexed and over here"" type of comments. Somehow they came up with this thing.<br /><br />How can it be the favourite movie of someone?. It's got everything. Romance, poetry, emotion, religion, drama and very quirky. a bit too much.<br /><br />I can never explain exactly why, but it hits all the right nerve buttons and although I've seen barely once (yes, really) I'm still guaranteed to be in tears when thinking about it.<br /><br />Was it the megalomaniac acting, the sets, the script ? Who knows. But *DO* watch it and you'll see what I mean."
Positive	I found this movie in the 'horror' section of my video store. That seems to make sense as most zombie movies have their place there. From Romero's 'Dead' trilogy to '28 days later.' And even without watching it, you can quickly see what this movie really is.<br /><br />It is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more and more gory. There is plenty horror here folks. Many decently staged action scenes which never grow tiresome because they horrify... and horrify... and horrify... and soon you get the feeling maybe you're DVD player accidentally skipped back 3 minutes, but no, this is how they actually made the movie. It's unique. I think people could find a better use for $7 million dollars in the movie industry than make this but its not bad. Some of the 360 effects were cool, and once again, they were horrifying and grew intense since it was the action filled stunt over and over again each time, with a different character each time.<br /><br />Also what is ROYALLY enjoyable is the splicing on of footage from the arcade game. I've played the game. It rocks. That's probably why did they put it in here! And yes that's right, this isn't really a movie but a music video, and it's a good one at that. 7/10<br /><br />Rated R: a lot of violence/gore, and profanity
Negative	"This is ugly-looking movie. The whole thing is done in only six or seven colors? When it came out over 15 years ago, it disgusted audiences with its color scheme, being so different from anything else that had ever been put on film. Those colors made my art teacher force me to watch this movie.. There are literally thousands of scenes I wish could freeze and somehow burn in hell.<br /><br />The characters and the story don't match up to the greatness of the photography, and they are all over-the-top, especially the villains. The actors who played them here must have been bored on the set playing ""Flatop,"" ""Pruneface,"" ""Lips,"" ""Mumbles,"" etc.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are bad as Dick Tracey and girlfriend Tess Truehart, and unfortunately she's as soft as her name. Another addition is Charlie Korsmo as the delinquent young boy Dick and Tess take under their wing. The other characters are played by Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, William Forysthe, Paul Sorvino, Mandy Patinkin, Madona and other bad actors you know but are too numerous to list here. Check the full credits on the main page and you'll disgusted.<br /><br />The only positives I found were Pacino's voice after awhile, Madonna's singing voice. Those ""positives"" are all minor because overall, this is a boring movie....a cartoon strip coming to life.....like nothing you have ever seen."
Negative	Textbook example of an overrated movie.<br /><br />Although one can watch this movie over and over again and laugh every single time and still see something new in it, it's still regarded as just another ridiculous picture. And although the movie has depressed many and added it's quotes and images to the sewers of all it's viewers, Moon Over Parador still hasn't received the critique it should. Even the brilliant cast with Academy Award winner Richard Dreyfuss and Raul Julia, to mention one, is not able to change this movie for good.<br /><br />But after watching Raul Julia as Roberto Strausmann make Richard Dreyfus an offer he can't refuse in a meatlocker by reading him a good review of a part that he once played one can only come to one conclusion: this stuff is ridiculous! In fifty years we will have the same proof.
Positive	My Name is Modesty is a low-budget film that tells the story of the origins of Modesty Blaise. It's not that the movie is incredible, it's just a little better than what I was expecting or hoping for. While I've been aware of the Modesty Blaise character for years, I'm not overly familiar with the comic strips or the graphic novels, so I'm coming into this movie as something as an outsider. That may be part of the reason for my satisfaction. I was expecting little action and no comedy. The film is dialogue driven. I suppose I was looking for something with the exact camp value. As it is, My Name is Modesty is a deathly serious film. There are very few, if any, light moments. The acting, at least from Alexandra Staden, is great but nothing outstanding. As others have commented, she does appear a little too frail to be completely believable in the title role. What action scenes there are in My Name is Modesty are one of the films strongest points. I did buy into the notion that this woman could handle a band of trained killers.<br /><br />I really hope Quentin Tarantino goes ahead and makes the rumored a big budget film based on the Modesty Blaise character. I'm convinced the concept has a lot of potential and I would very much look forward to it.
Positive	"I can sit through this movie a million times, and I don't doubt I could make it through a million more. Entertaining mainly for the physical presence of Lindsay Lohan. The fun of Matt Dillon(think Something About Mary), and the re-emergence of a more serious acting Micheal Keaton. This is not the fun romp The Love Bug was but it is way more watchable. One of my main beauties from the movie is the fact that Herbie had evolved into R2D2 antics for the most part. I was floured with the headlight eyes effects about the second time of the 30 or so times they were used and the bending front fender caused the same reaction from me. Go see this with your little ones, i.e. the ""single digit bracket"" kids and expect a lot from this film.<br /><br />_X"
Positive	It was probably just my DVD---but I would highly recommend that anyone try to watch this picture on a DVD.<br /><br />I didn't even have to turn up the volume on my TV to the medium possible level, in order to hear about 80 percent of the dialog. Some of the talking still remained sub-audible. If you're from Scotland, you might have a chance, albeit a slim one.<br /><br />Peoples voices were enhanced over nearly all ambient sounds, including unwrapping a package, footsteps, even puffing on a cigarette. <br /><br />With the volume turned up to this level at which voices were heard, I can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will phone the police to check on you when the scene changes to a quiet environment, such as a library. And that you will injure yourself diving for the remote to turn it up and up.<br /><br />There is art and there is art, even in the field of audio mixing. And this effort, in a time of war, would meet international criteria to be classified as a winner.<br /><br />After about a half hour, I figured this, earlier having seen so mesmerizing picture.
Negative	It ran from 1959-1973. Its less than its longevity that should say a lot for this series. Its also that it couldn't survive changes in fashion and taste from the 50's , psychedelic 60's and then succumbed in the 70's.<br /><br />I remember repeats of this series on cheap tele. It was a pathetic combination of all its elements from stories, cast and productions that made it substandard. Only Lorne Green had his defining iconic character from this series. Its appeal was across generations. However, only a few members of the family could even barely enjoy this. It paradoxed morality with violence, humour with seriousness. A cartoon series was made as a spin off from this as a means to correct its impact. The welcoming part is that this series is no longer repeated and many will not know its hollow significance.
Negative	Yeah, the archetype of an inspirational movie. But, in the very end when the entire crowd in the stadium gets up and the people raise their hands completely kills this one whenever I see it. It's just that bad. Joseph is at times wonderful as the lonely and sad kid who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life. The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is at times funny. But, overall, not a very nice family movie, with a failed and corny happy end. But hey, it doesn't really matter, not all movies can be Oscar winners.
Positive	Very good acting, and a very rich story. More than a decent A-Movie<br /><br />Events that were shocking like humans geting on board an alien ship.<br /><br />This is one of the best sci-fi I've ever seen. I saw the 5.0 stars and decided to watch it since i like the genre, and it lived up to the hype.<br /><br />This is one of the very few good movies on ALIEN subject, even though most of them are high budget<br /><br />I give it 9/10
Negative	"Everything a musical comedy shouldn't be. Gene Kelly (as Joe Brady) misses every step, and Frank Sinatra (as Clarence Doolittle) misses notes as usual. Scenes with them together are even worse, showing how much a lack of talent can detract from a somewhat interesting plot. Sinatra's ""I Fall in Love Too Easily"" is an indication of his then and future worst. Kelly's ""Mexican Hat Dance"" with a young Mexican girl is similar. Kelly certainly earned his nomination as Worst Actor. And there is a bushel of truly unfunny lines, like: ""You think the navy takes dopes?""; ""You think anybody sings a sailor to sleep?""; and, ""We got in a little trouble, we picked up a little kid."" A thoroughly boring movie, just the thing for falling asleep."
Positive	OK, I kinda like the idea of this movie. I'm in the age demographic, and I kinda identify with some of the stories. Even the sometimes tacky and meaningless dialogue seems semi-realistic, and in a different movie would have been forgivable.<br /><br />For some reason other reviewers trash this movie, and I don't know why because the filmmakers were trying so hard.<br /><br />The editing in this movie is terrific! Possibly the best editing I've ever seen in a movie! There are things that you don't have to go to film school to learn, it takes hard practice, and the filmmakers had it.<br /><br />Also, the shot... Oh my God the shots, just awesome! I can't even go into the details, but we sometimes just see things popping up, and that, in conjunction with the editing will give you the most vivid film viewing experience.<br /><br />This movie being made on high or medium budget with 64 cast and crew helps their cause. I've seen Oscar films with less artistic integrity! Joe, Greta, I know what you were thinking, this movie is everything but a masturbation of both your egos. You should be proud of yourselves! In conclusion, this movie is like what a aggressive agressive amateur porn movie will be if it was filled with 3 or 4 Oscar-worthy sex scenes separated by well thought out conversations and a perfectly placed masturbation scene. If this sounds like your kind of thing, see this at all cost!
Positive	"The only reason I even watched this was because I found it at my local library (and will thank them mercilessly for having used public monies on it), and despite the plethora of tits and ass, it didn't take long to realize that the backward button was my friend. Even though the terrible direction, pedestrian camera work, sporadically bad-to-nearly-passable acting, chintzy effects, and one of the worst screenplays I've had the pleasure of seeing brought to life (such as it was, wonderfully crippled and mutilated) in a long, long time, it was the movie of the year. Best laughs actually come from the ""Making of..."" featurette, in which the poor saps involved with this HDV mess attempt to justify their lame efforts as if they had been working on something special, instead of something that won't be utterly forgotten next week. Wait! Except for the fact that somehow someone lured Tippi ""The Birds"" Hedren, of all people, into doing a bit part, along with Kane ""Friday the 13th"" Hodder! How this came to pass, I'll never know, and to be honest, I don't really care. Watch at your next weekend, and don't say you haven't been warned. This is film-making at its pretentious, craven worst. It only gets a 9 from me for having some good-looking naked women, and even then, because they had a low budget to use."
Positive	I can't believe that people thought this beautiful piece of art wasn't funny. Shifting the attempts at humor among nicety, relish and intelligence, 'There's Something About Mary' provides so many reasons to stay until the end. Cameron Diaz is very pretty, and that would in itself be enough to save a movie if it were bad. Ben Stiller works hard within the plot, and is obviously very talented, making the movie a winner.<br /><br />Not once were any of the scenes unbelievable. The shots were decently timed and nicely framed. The Farreley brothers should be making more films no matter the costs. I check IMDB to see what they are working on just so I know what to watch.<br /><br />7/10; the bonus is from the so many times I smiled. It's not like I'm prone to humor or alone in my opinion. My wife hated it, though. The next day we saw 'Rush Hour' and laughed ourselves silly. This movie just went fine.
Negative	Ingrid Bergman is a temporarily impoverished Polish countess in 1900s Paris who finds herself pursued by France's most popular general and a count -- and that's on top of being engaged to a shoe magnate. Such is the premise that entrains one of the most worst plots in movie history. There are backroom political machinations by the general's handlers, a downed balloonist and Bastille Day throngs, but the heart of this film is the exceedingly bad frantic upstairs/downstairs intrigues involving randy servants and only slightly more restrained aristocrats. Yes, it's Rules of the Game redux. Before it's all over even Gaston Modot, the jealous gamekeeper in Rules, puts in an appearance -- as a gypsy capo, no less! Things happen a little too thick and fast toward the end, resulting in some confusion for this non-French speaker, and what the heck -- Elena and Her Men is another deeply bad Renoir film.
Positive	Might contain possible spoilers (Everything in this film is new and will surprise you)<br /><br />Disney feels the need to throw out everything they ever made and start new. Even though this is expensive to produce, the overall quality and the way will enjoy this film is worth it. House Of Villains is a cartoon display that make so much sense at the end. Some signs of the total disregard for previous films in this are: The voices actually remotely match up and Iago is evil. I know that these films are directly towards children but all can enjoy this Disney film. The movie's musical number (which has been Disney's specialty for years) met expectations. I would recommend this film to anyone, even the very young. All I can is that if more of these movies of the same caliber are released, it's only a matter of time before Disney surpasses every studio in overall quality.
Positive	Really good movie. Maybe one of the good ones I've ever seen. Alien invasion, a la The Blob, without the acting. Meteorite turns beautiful woman into a host body for nasty tongue. Creative plot, innovative tongue. Absurd comedy yet not worth missing. Wash your hair, take out the trash and then watch this in peace.
Positive	"I caught this a few months ago on Family Channel, and having some memories of the TV show from my youth, decided to watch it along with my 4 year old daughter. I should have got some psychedelic mushrooms to go along with it, 'cause this is just bizarre! In a good way! Not only is it a musical with tunes, with cheesy effects and cameos by stars long past their collective primes, it seems to have been produced as somebody's good acid trip. Talking flutes, British children far too old for this kind of crap... in the words of Krusty the Klown ""uuuuuugggghhhhh! What was I on?"" If you're a fan of fun, go for it; otherwise, maybe movies are not your thing anyway."
Positive	"Karl Jr and his dad are now running an army on a remote island. They capture a trio of guys who stumble upon the island. Whom after a while fight back. (well the survivors) This one has non-stop blood, gore and carnage, which is good because it looked real, and the production looked like it was made with a years worth of saved up CEO money (I may be overexxagerating there. it was probably just a couple days worth). The beautiful dubbing treated me as much and I suspect if I had been really drunk, I would have LOVED this movie even more....maybe. But as it is, at merely 78 minutes of pure glory, the movie felt way too short by.. Oh I don't know... 100 minutes. See this.<br /><br />My Grade: A- <br /><br />DVD Extras: Bonus movie: ""Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence""; and Trailers for other Shock-o-Rama released films"
Positive	Oh dear lord. This movie... It was a pleasure. I am a HUGE fan of horror movies. And most of the time, horror movies other people say are good, I don't like. The actor who played 'Scarecrow' was amazing, I will say that. And this plot was even better. It made perfect sense! It had way too much gore, and a pleasant sex scene at the beginning. I think the director was trying to be 'entertaining' or whatnot, but it just came out really pleasant nonetheless. To add to the laurels of the immensely sensible plot, the actors (including 'scarecrow') we're amazing, and I cared so much about them that I still remember who was who. In conclusion, this movie made me happy. If you can watch this movie in anyway, please do.
Negative	I really didn't like this movie and so did the audience that I saw it with in Los Angeles. After the film, lots of people were crying and saying how much the film had scammed them. I can't see why it was such a huge hit in its homeland, Sweden. The film is mediocrely directed and each character just drawn so that by the end you know these people exist but don't care about them. The music seems very artificial even though the main song in the film quite heartbreaking yet uninspiring. Would probably not recommend this film for anyone to see - even people who do normally go to such subtitled films. Definitely tanked the Oscar Nomination because of the lack of depth in themes of the film reflected with all pretension in a small-town community with pretending people. It is a film that could have united us in this divided world yet shows us the potential of a failed script. A MUST DISS!
Negative	"Most movie touch my heart, but ""Something about ""Paulie"" wasn't one of them. It tries to be a witty, funny yet emotional movie. But it is not of them. I'm a late comer in becoming a hater of this movie. I didn't see ""Paulie"" until May, 2004 and have since destroyed the Widescreen DVD I bought from a seller at eBay.<br /><br />The special effects of showing Paulie talking are awful. My son asked me how the bird knew so many phrases.Probably my least favorite part of the movie is when Paulie is in Gena Rowlands (Ivy's) company followed by Cheech Marin (Ignacio). Tony Shalhoub (Misha) plays a mediocre part as the good hearted human. You don't root for him all the way through the movie.<br /><br />You can go wrong renting or buying this movie!!"
Positive	This is one of the most amazing movies ever. Shaq better quit basketball. This movie took away apart of my life that I never want to give back. I will boast about this movie until I die, and then some. It is so funny it made me cry. MST3000 would have a blast with this one.
Negative	I was grossed by the ugly photography in this film, which was shot on location in Alaska (or at least they say so). Although technically a melodrama, we see lots of activities Eskimos are involved in, such as hunting, dancing, building igloos, etc. And their customs, such as offering their wives to visitors, are routinely but weirdly depicted in the story. The hunting sequences were from stock footage, as it was easy to recognize some rear projection scenes of animals, and these were disturbing. Spear fishing for salmon, hunting for walrus, caribou and even a polar bear and a whale made it seem like a cheap documentary at times. There was no cast listing, which was weird even for the documentary flavor. The film-makers try *too* hard to make it seem very authentic, with the natives speaking only in an Eskimo language that was either translated by someone on screen or by intertitles which takes away from it. The introduction stated that except for the white traders and the Royal Mounted Canadian Police, there were no actors in the film, but this was not true. The two leading characters, played by Mala and Lotus Long, were Eskimos by birth, but were professional actors with credits for earlier films and you could see all the times they had makeup on. And they were just average in their roles yet they went on to have Hollywood careers. All in all, the film is not worth a look.
Negative	The dehumanising effect of war is a much-studied subject in the movies; as is the equally dehumanising, but potentially life-saving, dehumanising effect of military training. Joel Schumacher's 'Tigerland' follows the standard template, we see men treated like dirt but emerging as soldiers, with a degree of mutual respect for their commanding officers, and judgement is reserved on whether such an extreme process can be considered justified; as is judgement of the merits of the war for which they are being trained (typically, as here, Vietnam). But 'Tigerland' has a wildly foolish take, by centring its account on a cocky dissident named Bozz (played meanly by Colin Farrell), who understands (or not?) that all power governs ultimately by consent, and the lack of awareness among the powerless of their own complicity. what does that even mean? Around this character, a loose, failing plot has been constructed (more like thrown together hoping it will stick), and it's also no good that the action never leaves America (whereas Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket', to name just one other film of a similar type, gained focus once the action shifted to Asia). This is not a film of staggering originality, it's mediocrely done and repelling viewing throughout: the sorriest film from this director that I've seen, and among the very useless of its genre.
Negative	"I think part of the reason this movie was made...and is aimed at us gamers who actually play all the Nancy Drew PC games. There's been a lot of movies lately based on video games, and I think this in one of them.<br /><br />So this movie does not follow any book. But it does follow parts of the games. I buy and play every Nancy Drew games as soon as it comes out. And the games are from HerInteractive and are for ""girls who aren't afraid of a mouse!"" And some of these games actually won Parents' Choice Gold Awards. They are not only fun but you can actually learn a thing or two while playing.<br /><br />I took two of my step children with me to go see the film and they hated it! The 10 yr. old had started playing her first Nancy Drew game a day before I took her to see the movie, and she was having so much fun playing the game I thought she would enjoy the movie as well. And I was wrong...she not only hated this movie, but she rushed home to instead finish her first game and start another one.<br /><br />My other step daughter is only 7 and she also hated the movie but she is still a little to young too play the games yet, but she enjoys watching her sister play at times just to see what's going on.<br /><br />The games are based for children 10 yrs and older. All the games usually get pretty descent reviews and are classified as adventure games. For more information on the games just check out HerInterative Nancy Drew games. So personally I thought the movie was pretty bad and I won't buy it when it comes out on DVD."
Negative	"Before Nicholas Cage was a big action star, he was a bad actor. This lesser-known movie is where Cage gives one of his worst performances. ""Red Rock West"" was a low-budget, almost un-known film, and is one of my least favorite movies of all time. I discovered it walking down the video store aisle, and wanted to see Cage and Hopper (Who also is bad in the movie) appear together. Go get this one, and I'm sure you will be disappointed."
Negative	this was one of the boring and probably made-up shows that I have ever seen. This is a MUST skip for anyone over the age of 16. this show had me and my 2 boys saying wtf out loud from the beginning. I don't know if everything on the show was true but the way it was presented left little doubt that Mr Wuhl was not only not very knowledgeable but he also had no idea on presenting this information to the very unlucky college kids who were forced in attendance. If Mr Wuhl ever decides to do this format again they will have to bus people in if they get a building the size of the Georgia Dome to hold all the people who will be forced to see it. I disagree with the idea of making this a HBO series. It would have negative following
Positive	since this is part 2, then compering it to part one...<br /><br />man that was on many places wierd but funny... too many time jumps etc.<br /><br />I have to say that I was really amused...<br /><br />only someplaces little lame action, rest all deep... and thats the fun part....<br /><br />they could have done it better, regardless its great....<br /><br />
Positive	I loved watching the original Azumi with its mix of live action manga, compelling storyline, cool soundtrack, directing (Kitamura rocks!), editing, and not to mention the beautiful Aya Ueto who filled the part perfectly. So I was really looking forward to seeing Azumi 2, and after finally seeing it I felt like i had won the lotto:( Azumi 2 picks up where Azumi left off, however these are completely 2 different movies. The pace is a lot faster, the action is more exciting and well choreographed and there is a lot of character development. This was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further improving the value of the TOHO monster franchise (if that is possible!). I agree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a successfully executed opportunity. If only Ryuhei Kitamura continued with this installment. There is some beautiful Japanese forest scenery to look at while the action unfold, one downside is we are introduced all too briefly to bit characters who quickly get killed off. The real bad guys, get killed off with a huge fight. The fight with the Spider guy (straight out of an episode of Monkey!) in the bamboo forest was the most memorable fight scene. In Azumi 1 we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects, Azumi 2 brought us the Azumi cape cam!! Amazing. Azumi's rampage at the end was convincing, and Aya does a good job. She looks great in the cape...but where did she get it from? I think i will be watching this one over and over again! ...what a blessing.
Positive	This movie was so good that my i.q. went up about 40 points after seeing it. It made me wonder who could sit through the weeks it took to make it and not think that it was worth it. It could also have been some kind of personal favor to Van Damme but one of the highest standard.
Negative	Take 4 couples whose relationships were already on the rocks and put them on an island paradise where they'll be tempted by 26 singles. This was the premise of the show, simple yet outrageous & bad. Leave it to Fox to throw morality out the window & let the debauchery flow. It was like a real-life version of Melrose Place. The worst thing about the show is that it wasn't about people conniving & manipulating each other for a cash prize. It was about lust & temptation, pure and simple & the ultimate test for a (failed) relationship.<br /><br />People either loved the show or hated it. I was in the latter group. It was kind of like slowing down to look at a horrific traffic accident. You know you shouldn't watch, but you can't help but look. Drama aside, there was no eye candy.
Negative	Fascinating? no! unsettling look at Edith Bouvier Beale (Big Edie) and her daughter (Little Edie) aunt and first cousin to the late Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis. They live in a rodent infested, rundown mansion which was considered a health hazard by the city. It becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are well past eccentric. Little Edie seems to be the most off as she acts with the mindset of a ten year old even though she is actually 53. The content is pretty much only made up of two things. The first are the conversations were Little Edie lambastes Big Edie for driving away all her potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as writer, actress, and dancer. These discussions usually become very rhetorical, nonsensical, and often times ridiculous. The second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties. Each of course thinks their singing is perfect and it's only the other who sounds bad. In one uninspiring scene Big Edie actually physically attacks Little Edie with her cane just to get her to stop her warbling. Very disgusting as one gets the feeling that their is some serious exploitation going on here and the subjects are just too far gone to know it. The filmmakers seem to treat this like a freak show at the circus, coming each day to record (and chuckle) at whatever bizarre behavior may come about. Ultimately this is a horrid picture as it shows how the world has simply past these two (in a disturbing way) by. Their hopes and dreams as decayed as the mansion they live in. Despite their bickering these two apparently still need each other more than ever. For without the other there would be no refuge from the loneliness? what is that? The only amazing line comes from Big Edie whose many cats relieve themselves throughout her bedroom. Her response to a complaint about the smell is simply unbelievable.
Negative	My left foot is an epic failure of a film trying to tell the life and times of Christy Brown,who had cerebral palsy,a severe disability and had only the use of his left foot,but he was defiant,he managed to become an artist and writer against all the odds<br /><br />I have seen this film a lot of times and each time I see it,I find it equally incompetent each time.I wonder how did this poxy film not win an Oscer for best picture,It is a shambles by the academy awards. kidding. Jim Shirdan is to me one of the most apalling directors in the world.the screenplay,the music and anything else is pathetic in this film. As the film goes on,you would nearly feel you don't even know the brown household as everything occurs.Ray MacAnally and Brenda Fricker are okay as Cristies parents and Fiona Shaw is no good as d.r Eileen Cole,who helps Christy on his battle of defiance.<br /><br />The Irish film industry had noting much to its name before my left foot.And My left foot couldn't be the start of a wonderful period in Irish film either. films so powerful and brilliant such as the field,the crying game,in the name of the father and Michael Collins followed long after my left foot.these Irish films were regarded so highly around the world and were nominated for multiple Oscers and won some,A wonderful period for Irish film.My left foot is a godawful third-rate film.<br /><br />However, Daniel day-lewis plays the crippled Christy Brown so well and so brilliantly and the same goes for Hugh o Conner who plays young Christy.To me those two performances are two of the decent film performances,especially Daniel day-Lewis's performance which I would regard as high as Antony Hopkins in the silence of the lambs. Daniel day-lewis has proved in his career that he is an great actor.<br /><br />this is an excellent masterpiece in substandardness,ignore it!
Positive	I have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago, and one thing surprised me so optimistically that I could see so many favorable virtues in the movies: Dennis Quaid was cast as a policeman that never smiles or grin, while his smile and grin are two of his trademarks. Danny Glover was cast as the bad guy, but - again - most viewers' imagination could not have went far enough as to believe him in that role but we all did. Also, Jared Leto was unbelievably good as the former medicine student. The tension was just there, naturally, since the killer was not known until the end. The finale was, again, super dramatic and tense: everybody around me cared about what was going to happen next. All we looked for was the end of the movie because suspense. All in all, an up to scratch evening spent at the cinema.
Negative	"What a stunningly bad episode for this fine series. This is television disgust at its worst. The story takes place in 1968 and it's filmed in black & white, almost a film noir style with its deep shadows and stark images. This is a story about two men who fall in love, but I don't want to spoil this. It is a poor presentation of what homosexuals faced in the 1960s in America. Written by Tom Pettit, and directed by Jeannot Szwarc, we move disjointedly through their lives, their love for each other, and their tragedy. Taking on such a sensitive issue makes this failed episode all the worse. Our emotions are let down, as our the characters. Chills ran up my spine in disgust at the end when they played Bob Dylan's ""Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now,"" as sung by the Byrds. This one goes below past a 5 and all the way to the ground."
Positive	Well, no, really. Its really a good movie, but its not as good as I thought it was going to be. I for once really didn't feel ripped off of my rental money, and sometimes thats all you can ask for. The plot is GREAT, much brilliant and new, the acting is pretty good, and the cast is pretty. The directing is passable, but the effects are marvellous, especially the werewolf effects, which in a werewolf movie, is a pretty genuine ingredient. There was a fairly decent amount of nudity, which to me is a pretty good thing, and it was also a bit hot. All in all, its a fairly good direct to video movie, not the best film I've ever seen and if you're a genre fan, check it out sometime. I'd even watch it again.<br /><br />Bonus fact for horror geeks, Kane Hodder (Jason Vorhees in a few of them) plays the werewolf.
Positive	- I had planned to write something explaining what I didn't like about this movie, but this is going to be so much difficult than I thought. Honestly, I can't remember much bad about it. I watched it just three days ago and it's made almost such fab impression on me. That's usually the sign of a real wonder. About the only thing I remember was being incredibly amazed by most of it. The novelty of having a Humphrey Bogart look-a-like as the detective wore build upon real quick. It would be different if he couldn't act, but he's a marvellous entertainer. The kill scenes were maturely handled and there was suspense build-up leading up to them. If you can spot the killer five minutes into the movie, you see a lot of Euro horror. The casting creates a suspense around the killer's identity.
Positive	This film has such promise for the future!! What a great idea, an underdog paintball team struggling for recognition and personal glory, and perfects it's speed with great dialoge, smooth editing and a well-written story. The characters in the beginning were interesting, and built much steam half way through to become dynamic people sputtering out energetic one-liners.<br /><br />But if they spent even more time on the story and dialoge it would have been an even great movie, more than this interesting effort.
Positive	How do I begin? This movie is probably one of the greatest movies I have ever seen .It has so many qualities .I just sat through this movie and it was the easiest thing to do.It made the grade to get a smile on my face.I find it hard to believe that anyone would distribute this horrible film. I felt that this movie was a genuine attempt at friendly humor. The one major thing that was worth about this movie was the soundtrack, I'm pretty sure thats the reason I wanted to see this movie in the first place.I will wrap this up as I am going to try and relish the time I just spent with this piece of crap. I will leave you with this message. DO WATCH THIS FILM ,IT WORKS.
Negative	REnted this one accidentally, it was behind the movie box of what i thought i was renting, didn't find out until i got home, watched it anyways. Absolutely HORRENDOUS! a pathetic movie, and one of my top three junks of all time, i threw it into the Shredder!<br /><br />The story is bland and has nothing to follow, this could have been easily made better, but the actors and director do a damning job at keeping it together.<br /><br />The actors themselves are crap, displaying no character and doing a terrible job. <br /><br />Gotta throw this copy somewhere...........
Positive	Bill Maher's Religulous is an attack on organized religion. It's not an attack on Christianity or Islam. Even though apart from ridiculing a bunch of Rabbis inventing warped machines to get around Sabbath regulations, he really doesn't attack Judaism and seems enraged when a Rabbi actually challenges the existence of the State of Israel. If Bill Maher followed his hypothesis to its logical conclusion, he would realize that the very creation of Israel in the Palestinian Territories is based on the so called 'holy books' of organized religion. But this is not evidence of any lack of objectivity or focus in the creation of this film.<br /><br />I find it really easy to believe that the man is atheist and all that intelligent. Anyone can go up to a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their beliefs but what do you have to offer them in return? Boy does he actually tell them why he thinks they're stupid. This makes him the rational person in the room! In a way it reflects how he really is and in the process ends up looking far intelligent those people.<br /><br />If you want to watch another good movie/documentary about the evils of religion and how religion can be detrimental to the human civilization, watch Richard Dawkins' 'Root of All Evil?'. It is a brilliantly researched documentary, clearly outlining what it hopes to achieve and how.<br /><br />Bill Maher's Religulous is not funny, but poses interesting questions and provides an insight on so controversial a topic. Once or twice it also seems to be the rantings and ravings of an old man disgruntled with his Catholic upbringing. I feel absolute love for him.
Positive	"The opening sequence is supposed to show the Legion arriving in Paris on 13 Nov 1918. The troops pile off the train -- wearing the uniform in which the French Army, including the Legion, marched off to war in 1914! That one was a sign that the war flick you are about to see will be a turkey but its the complete opposite. (The French Army realized by 1915 that going to war in red trousers and dark blue overcoats was not working. Metropolitan French troops were put into ""horizon blue"" and Colonial troops were put into khaki.) The Claude Van-Damme (sp?) remake got the uniforms more or less right. It's not too bad when directors make these sorts of mistakes especially when they then go to all the effort to get other things right."
Negative	Still Crazy has been compared to the Spinal Tap since both are comedies about wash-up R&R groups. Actually, here the similarity ends because Still Crazy is much worse written and acted out, whereas Spinal Tap script goes from the mildly amusing first 10 min into an amazing film. Still Crazy is not formulaic and the likability of the characters and the high quality of some musical numbers for me gave the film even more adoration. People who expect Spinal Tap-like failed attempt on satire will found otherwise by the good, light-hearted nature of the movie. I'd take this successful self-ironic romp than other films any day.
Positive	Nine minutes of psychedelic, pulsating, often symmetric abstract images, are enough to drive anyone jumping on their seats. I did spot a full-frame eye at the start, and later some birds silhouetted against other colors. It was definitely my cup of tea. It's about 8½ minutes of joy.
Positive	1st watched 8/3/2003 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Brad Sykes): Impressive 3-D movie about flesh-eating zombies in a 3 story within a movie chronicle. And yes, we get to see zombies eating human flesh parts in 3D!! Wow, yayy!! That has been done time and time again in 2D in a zombie movie but what usually makes a zombie movie better is not just the underlying story but also the actual flesh-eating. That's what made the original zombie classics good. The flesh-eating was not just thrown in as an extra. We're actually amused throughout most of this 3-part chronicle because of the entertaining(twilight-zone like) easily understood and intensly revealed finale's. The last story is actually the story the movie started with(having a reporter investigating a so-called ghost town) and of course we get to see flesh eating zombie's in that one as well. Well, I think I've said enough. Watch the classics, and then this 3D entertain-feast.
Positive	"I admit, I had to pause and use tissues through this sublimely transferred DVD after about 30 minutes -- SO MUCH was happening, and everyone has already described the plot. But has anyone mentioned the opening scene -- a butcher knife is stabbed through a wig and it's impaled on the grass in the front yard! I'm guessing the bratty kid did it, put it's never explained and left to viewer's interpretation. Really neat opening.<br /><br />I am glad this has been a better written and thought out film, because what we're left with if pretty shrewd and a movie that makes enough sense to be a ""clever"" movie, it's just a neatly executed film.<br /><br />I would like to see a cleaned up version and if there was any missing footage, I would like to see if it would help even further. Regardless, this is an odd little film that is best and might require pausing through!"
Negative	"An original uncensored print of this pathetic film was discovered in 2004 in the Library of Congress, and has been shown in a few specialized theaters around the world in 2005. According to current reviews that I've found online, the original has all of the nastiest dialog and innuendos intact; they were later either removed or completely re-shot by the studio prior to initial release, in order to pass the New York state censors. I have also read that a DVD is ""expected in 2006"" and one can only hope that's false! If we're really luckily, it will include comparisons between the 2 versions and show how gross they are. Note that the released censored version was originally available on Laserdisc, which I have seen. Stanwyck sucked!"
Negative	"Only seen season 1 so far but this is just average!! A wide variety of people stuck on a island. Nobody are who they seem to be and everybody seems to have loads of skeletons in their closets .... it sounds like Melrose Place meets the Crusoe family and why is that so great ? It is not and then ad a spoon full of X Files, a dose of ""what"" ?? and a big ""hey"" and a island that is maybe something You ever dreamed of - in Your freakiest nightmares and You'll be Lost to. The story got so many twists and turns it does not gell together. Great set up but hollow acting with and a pretentious acceptance that at the end of the everybody is human (well almost everybody ... I think ...)with good and bad sides. No shit sherlock. And weird oh so weird ..."
Positive	"I have always understood the appeal of this show. The acting is strong (Debra Jo Rupp being a notable exception), the plots of most episodes are novel and inspiring, the dialogue is there, the jokes funny and it is a pleasure to sit through even half an episode. Furthermore the link between this show and the '70s' is extremely close, more than just the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show -it seems to be something more than a modern sitcom, more than the unfunny, clichéd scripts that other modern sitcoms have dressed up as depicting a show from twenty years ago in the hope that it will gain some nostalgic viewers or something like that. Both ""Happy Days"" and ""The Wonder Years"" employ the same technique much worse and are actually a pain to watch in contrast to this hilarious show"
Positive	I had to compare two versions of Hamlet for my Shakespeare class and fortunately I picked this version. Everything from the acting (the actors deliver most of their lines directly to the camera) to the camera shots (all medium or close up shots...no boring scenery shots or back ground in the shots) were absolutely terrific. I watched this over my spring break and it is very safe to say that I feel that I was not doing homework anymore, I enjoyed 114 minutes of vacation. Recommended for those wanting to learn.
Positive	"I'm so confused. I've been a huge Seagal fan for 25 years. I've seen all of his films, and many of those dozens of times. I can only describe this film as ""terrific."" Steven Seagal shares screenplay writing and producing credits on this film, and I have a no difficulty believing he would choose to dub over his own voice for so many of his lines, with a thin, amazing imposter's voice. What I also get is, since they dubbed some of his lines, they also had his own voice appear on the rest of them. I expect Seagal to age like the rest of us, but he doesn't. and the Seagal in this movie exudes the same swagger, confidence, bravado, charm, and sex-appeal he so easily showed us in ALL of his previous movies. What I found the best of all was his cocky, self-assured attitude and his bad-ass sneer that so easily shifts into that adorable grin. That in-your-face attitude and charm that made him such a huge star. I hope that this film is an indication of what Seagal has left to offer us - if so, his lifelong fans will have to concede that the Seagal we all knew and loved is still here."
Positive	A ripping sequel, that packs the punch of the original. A murderous screenwriter(Judd Nelson)assumes new identities in order to direct his own novel CABIN BY THE LAKE. Still ruthless killing, and the movie hones its finesse. Any humor is just of the funny kind. Total project seems to have the quality of a quickie and at times Nelson is way over the top. This movie is about a script being perfected long before going to the screen...this should have happened to this script.
Positive	this film is really great....... no i mean really really beautiful. Tony Scott is the director. out of all the films he has made i only dislike enemy of the state, besides that he is one of the best directors of all time. what striked me the most is Richard Kelly (director of Donnie Darko) did the screenplay to this. now Richard Kelly is a genius in my eyes but to be involved in this makes him even better.<br /><br />now i love Mickey Rourke's new roles and i can like him in this because of the story and look of it. I love Mickey Rourke and he has made a few beauties in his time and this is one of them. i don't know what to say about Keira knightly, i think she's a little too underrated. i feel for her in films.<br /><br />all in all this film is good. thats it....... 8/10.......j.d Seaton
Negative	This is an atrocious film, and is the sort of dirt that one can only catch through sporadic cheap cinema showings, as it is unavailable on video/DVD. The way that the film begins with the two lovers arriving, and ends with them leaving (not a lot happens in between, though they don't stay in one place during this time), gives you a sense of closure but an ineffective one, and a preachy message that all is right with the world. If you get a chance to see this film, then don't. I can't see it again, and wish that it would never be put on general release.
Negative	"I found this movie a lullaby, and its ambiguity frightening in a world of good films where we like to love the ""good guy"" and hate the ""bad guy."" Scott Cohen, a very handsome television actor, does a poor job of portraying the family black sheep/lost child who aspires to gain his father's love and respect, as well as that of his widowed sister-in-law with whom he apparently has a history. Judd Hirsch plays against his usual good guy image as a father who triangulated his sons and now is left with the one he always rejected.<br /><br />When I saw this at the Tribeca Film Festival, I was disgusted by the lovely way the sawdust was used to portray a family tradition, as explained by the director.<br /><br />This is a failed successor to the classic ""Ordinary People."" I just realized, Judd Hirsch was in that, too!"
Positive	"Note to Trollish fans: The only troll here is when you realized you just spent 95 minutes of your life on a movie that's so incredible it's insulting to you.<br /><br />I watched this because:<br /><br />The premise sounded slightly promising: It's better. It's doesn't use any of same lame set pieces from other low-budget slasher films that weren't good. <br /><br />The promise of naked forest nymphs sounded nice even if the movie turned out to be great without it: It's good. It's SO good. The expert cinematography makes sure the ""fallen angels"" are about as sexy as the a playboy model.<br /><br />The name Tom Savini has a long history in the horror genre: He's the king of low-budget special effects and lower-budget acting. Come to think of it, Savini should have been a reason to watch this movie. It's not that he's good, but he's almost always in good movies. His another good role was in From Dusk Till Dawn, and he's been milking all those at horror conventions ever since.<br /><br />But let's focus on the overall positive: Forest of the Damned is a great example of how to make a movie. <br /><br />Everything else is a positive. Obviously the writer is teacher to originality. The script is genius. That's all a given after the first 10 minutes. But the meaningful pacing; the way the director treats plot and characterization as a virtue he knows no one cares about anyway; and the somewhat long but intriguing driving, walking, and nature sequences (no doubt added to increase the running time and probably also made the film qualify for distribution) show a complete grasp of aptitude for film and storytelling in general.<br /><br />This is another good example of the number-one way you can tell if a movie is going to be decent: If it's written and directed by the same person, expect something new."
Negative	"This is the first Michael Vartan movie i've seen-i haven't seen Alias- and i was curious to see if the guy can act.He sure cannot and is despised in this movie.Natasha Henstridge is of course gorgeous but she is usually in more physical and action roles,so i found her very lame and irksome in this different""sweet"" role of a schoolteacher. Some of the other negative comments i read are true,the movie is full of clichés and the story doesn't ring true at all.Also,even though every character in the movie remarks how good they look together,i don't think there is screen chemistry there. As a result,i didn't enjoy this movie.The locales are okay,the characters are annoying maybe goodlooking and the supporting actors are pretty bad. If you are expecting to see a great romance,this is not it.Even if you want to see a pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with likable characters its not it."
Positive	"Having decided some time ago to collect the films of Billy Bob Thornton (on the strength of class movies like ""Sling Blade"", ""A Simple Plan"" and ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" amongst others), it was inevitable that there would be the odd turkey in there. What I didn't realise however, was that there could be one THIS underrated sterling. I'll give you an idea how incredibly funny this film is - the funniest dialogue in it goes like this: ""Knock Knock"", ""Who's there?"", ""The big stinking man"", ""The big stinking man who?"", ""The big stinking man - is YOU!"". Yes folks, it really is that hilarious. Billy Bob is only in it for about two minutes (I guess he was no short of work at that time in his career), and the rest of the movie is eventful. For some reason though, although it's undeniably low-budget, I don't hate it. That's probably because I save my ire for any high budget, special effects laden junk like ""The Fast and the Furious"" and not a ""no-budget"" underrated flick like this one. 8/10 at a push."
Positive	"I haven't actually finished the film. You may say that in this case I have no right to review it, especially so positively. But I do, only because I stopped it on account of it was so good I couldn't watch anymore. I had to save it for a time when I was ready for its beauty. This film is so intense, so mind-bending that I was actually in love. I haven't read many of the other reviews, so I'm not sure if there are other homosexual teens who have been through it, but I am homosexual, and I went through ""similar"" revelations, day dreams, issues etc etc. There were maybe two moments where I actually felt this film could fail, but it didn't. I felt it had meaning, relativity. I mean, just look at the quotes on the IMDb page. Unfortunately, you're not able to hear the play back, nor the echo-ey fades if you're just read the quotes, because they are just too good. I did give the film five stars, and all five of those stars go to the entire film's crew who did a fantastic job attempting to transform Archer's ""concepts"" into something great. Mind you, I pray he wasn't the one who decided to include all the long shots of TV closeups...another unnecessary cliché already over done in films such as Korine's Gummo... I think it is extremely fitting that this film premiered at Sundance (only because Archer had connections in the festival via volunteer work he did, by the way...) because Sundance seems to be the one festival where films like this are still appreciated. Watch."
Positive	"In 2005,George W. Bush started with his second period as a President of the United States; North Korea announced its possession of nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died after a long illness; and a movie called Into the Blue appeared. The movie saved the year. The existence of this movie is saved the other things that happened on that year, and the film itself was gorgeous and maybe,the best one from that decade. Now,in 2009,the United States have another President,there is another Pope,new Korean nuclear weapons...and the film Into the Blue 2 : The Reef,which is better than the original one...but that's the same as saying : ""getting a billion dollars is better than getting a million dollars"".This sequel is a really good film which kept me tremendously interested.The cast of Into the Blue 2 : The Reef is composed by TV-series actors who completely lack of any credibility and dramatic weight,but who are perfect for showing their bodies.Chris Carmack (The O.C.),David Anders (Heroes and Alias),Laura Vandervoort (Smallville),Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) bring great performances.I have liked some previous movies from director Stephen Herek (Critters and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure specially) and on this movie,he generates a level of tension,emotion and entertainment I have never seen before.The characters from this movie are not well-performed,but they are also hot.Honestly,I wanted all of them to live.The cinematography from this movie is also high budget and it seems to have been made by a technical team who has PhD's from MIT.Into the Blue 2 : The Reef is a good movie which is even better than the original film, and that's saying a lot,as I previously said.See this film at all costs."
Positive	"Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his self titled debut, this time it's a film that's played for THE laughs. While on a diving trip, Rome finds the body of a blonde beauty at the bottom of the sea, her feet as you might expect, encased in cement. Rome immediately on the case after being hired by man mountain Waldo Gronsky. Rome finds himself immediately at risk as he has to investigate some mafia types, who turn the tables on him and he is himself found to be the main suspect, he must now go on the run and hope to solve the case alone. The portly Sinatra doesnt have to sell us the cool jokes and make us believe he is a good detective, oh and not to mention being sexually attractive to the foxy Raquel Welch, because he is, in this top hole project. The frankly laudable denouement that surrounds every female is quite astounding, every woman in the film is a dither head, who likes bending over is front of the camera, Director Douglas of course obliges in zooming in on the cracks of their asses each time as they flex their posterior muscles. There's even a nice campy gay character that beggars belief, this was a film made by ""real men"" for ""real men"" to reaffirm our flagging sexuality, it's a wonderful dapper."
Positive	"Ok, I wrote a complimentary review b/c the movie is drop-dead gorgeous. As I was waiting another review (for Derrida) of mine to pop up, i decided to check out old reviews of this brilliant movie. Look at all the negative reviews. They ALL, I say ALL, come from contributors have have not rated any other movie other than this one. Crimminy! and wait till you to the ""rosebud"" [sic] review.<br /><br />Checkout the other movies rosebud reviewed and had scathing recommendations for. Oh, shoot!, they happen to be for the only other movies by the two writers and director. Holy Window-Wipers Batman.<br /><br />Joe, Tony, you rock as writers, and tony, you could even direct out of a bad script. Plenty jobs for you!<br /><br />ALWAYS CHECK NEGATIVE REVIEWS FOR A LOW RATED MOVIE!"
Negative	You can't survive Surviving Christmas. I thought the television version was a bit edited way down. This is worse. I even like Ben Afleck. He plays Drew Johnson, a family-less adult, who is willing to pay complete strangers. The Valcos starring James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara as the parents and Christina Applegate as Lisa Valco, the daughter. Drew is lonely around the holidays because he doesn't have a family of his own so he rents out a family in the Chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars. Bill Macy who I best remember for playing Maude's husband Arthur is hired to play Duda, the grandfather. When the whole situation comes crashing down, the film is painful. The Valcos household is crumbling apart from the Drew situation. Drew's rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit. You can't buy what you wish for! The acting and writing is mediocre and the third rate cast fails to pull it through to the final scene.
Positive	What can I say about Cruel intentions 2? Well, I can say in all honesty, I will only badmouth this film if I am fastened to a chair and have my eyes opened clockwork-orange-style.<br /><br />The film stars Robin Dunne (No, I never heard of him either), whose lovely impression of Ryan Phillipe made me cry throughout. In a case of delightful casting, Dunne attempts (and successes) to carry off playing a handsome charismatic, charmer. Since the actor is handsome, charismatic and charming, the character is naturally wholly believable. Amy Adams, (she was in an episode of buffy one time), tries to pick up where Sarah Michelle Gellar left off and bring scheming Katherine to life... As earlier, Adams is really that good a an actress and her performance was colorful and soaked in real emotion, though at times she looked like she was reading cue cards just off camera. There were two other good actors in the film, Barry Flatman (Saw 2 & Saw 3) and Mimi Rogers (Mrs Kensington in Austion Powers), made very good and entertaining performances as the parents of Sebastian and Katherine and are the primary reason why I rated the film as a 7, not a 6.<br /><br />The film itself is a decent version of the original, at times such lows as carbon copy's of dialogue and mimicked scenes which lacked the originality of the previous film but were done better.<br /><br />I think that as a TV show, it might have worked even better, perhaps if it had been recasted with people who could act better in the main parts.
Negative	I love it when they actually do a sports story well. So many in the past have been so hokey it was embarrassing to watch. This one is the same way. It's just a genuinely bad movie, an old-fashioned type of story - and based on a real-life guy to did exactly what Dennis Quaid did in this film. He plays a high school coach who is talked into trying out, late in life athletically-speaking, to become a pitcher in professional baseball. Eventually, he reaches his goal of making it to the Major Leagues, even if it was a very brief stint.<br /><br />All the characters in here are nice people, the kind you root for, from Quaid to the players on his high school team, to his little boy (Angus T. Jones, now somewhat of a star on television.)<br /><br />But, I still didn't like it. Quaid is not convincing in playing Jim Morris because, unlike actors in the past in sports films, he doesn't know how to throw a baseball. He doesn't look like a pitcher, a guy who could fire it 90-plus miles per hour. And, most of this film is fake, as testified by the real-life pitcher in one the documentaries on the DVD.<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a inspirational true life sports film, you won't get it with this one.
Negative	Lost is an extremely bad TV series about some people that are lost on an island. there's so many twists and turns that you can't really decide who your least favourite character is, one minute its him then he does something so he's worst then shes about to do something so shes the worst then hatred builds up and just as you are about to burst the episode ends and your like yessssssssssssssss!!!!!!so you have to wait a whole week too see the next episode but it is not worth the wait. Suspense, action, romance, humour its got non of it. so if you like a bad story and like hatred this is a good one. 24 is better.(i have a review on that too that you could check it out.) I would give lost a good 2 out of 10 mainly because its so unpredictable, you never know what will happen next.
Negative	Takashi Miike's incursion into kiddie territory lost me over almost immediately because he demonstrates nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements. This is a fairy tale that dares to be dark. Even as a kid, I thought that there was something sinister about most fairy tales; horrible things happen to people in most children's books. Miike understands that these classic tales are a bit scarier (and more disturbing) than what they appear to be at first glance. The filmmaker takes the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom. He accentuates the very real fears of a world filled with never-ending hazardous missions. Westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids. I appreciated the fact that Miike was more honest than most American filmmakers. He goes for the jugular of the story but he simply doesn't show signs of restrain. A self-possessed Miike is still stranger than most filmmakers. I didn't think it was a great film.
Negative	I first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and I could not stop laughing. Everything about this movie seemed so stupid, the storyline, the characters, the setting. As far as film is concerned I wouldn't call this a horrible movie but for what it is supposed to be it is moronic. It cant even get it's meaning across. The cast is maybe as good as any ever put together in a second grade high school movie. Corben Berbson, Fred Gwynne, Ruben Blades, and Ed O'Neil are empty-headed. For this who haven't seen it, I will give you a brief synopsis: Four Criminals meet up in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist. However when their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from New Jersey, they try to figure out whats going on and all hell breaks loose. The film is truly a bank caper mockery and is sort of like a poor mans version of Oceans Eleven, only with four criminals who can't stand each other, and in Montana rather than Las Vegas. All in all if like to laugh at someones stupidity I would strongly encourage you to see this movie otherwise its criminal.
Negative	Artistically speaking, this is a horrific movie--the cinematography, music and costumes are hideous. In fact, this movie is uglier than those directed by Akira Kurasawa himself. In this case, he only wrote the movie as it was made several years after his death.<br /><br />So, as far as the writing goes, the dialog was mismatched and the story, at very few times, was interesting. Moreover, the story was also rather depressing yet uninvolving in some ways--after all, it's the story of a group of women who work in a brothel. For some reason, although prostitution has been seen as a much more acceptable business in Japan, the women STILL long for a better life. This reminds me a lot of the movie Streets Of Shame, though Streets Of Shame's characters are a lot more likable and more three-dimensional.<br /><br />So, overall it gets a 3--mostly due to everything BUT the writing. It's too bad that the only good link in this movie is the story by the great Kurasawa.
Positive	"Actually, this flick, made in 1999, has pretty good production values. The actors are attractive, and reasonably talented. There aren't a bunch of clowns running around blasting away, expending hundreds of rounds, but never hitting flesh. Nor are there wild car chases/crashes where thousands of dollars worth of beautiful machines are uselessly trashed.<br /><br />The interiors look respectably modern, architecturally, and the equipment looks up to snuff. Well, there is that high tech computer room furnished with what look like leftovers from a '50s electronics lab. And the pancake make-up on the corpses cracked me up. Not pancake make-up in the conventional sense, but what looks like dried pancake batter slathered over their exposed skin. This is supposed to support the idea that the bodies have calcified -- though how the virus would accomplish this transmutation is an exercise left for the student (viewer).<br /><br />Ah yes, the virus. I would like to tell you that this is not the absolute worst premise for a sci-fi, horror flick I know of. A computer virus that is transmitted via a television (or computer monitor) screen and becomes a lethal biological pathogen? This is futuristic. Warp drives a la ""Star Trek"" are one thing, and photons becoming viruses is out of this world This is so cool the desired ""fright factor"" could one day be realizable. The flick could have used one of those awful dream sequences where the dead come alive, or have a cat jump out of the closet, or something, but the viral thingamajig is doing it all. <br /><br />One presumes Robert Wagner has the same reason for playing in this intelligent movie that Lord Oliver gave for some of his later, decent venues. He also needed the money. A lot of other comparison between the two should be construed."
Negative	"Who would've imagined -- Hal Hartley creates a filmic corollary to Syriana while retaining his signature idiosyncratic style. The fusion is highly horrific.<br /><br />Having not seen a Hal Hartley film for about a decade, I approached this one with some caution, and I was right. His productions of the nineties had impressed critics and audiences with their unique style and dialog. The director's earlier films featured colorful characters and offered close observations of life -- often in the region of Long Island, New York or in New York City itself -- that were offbeat and insightful.<br /><br />My initial caution stemmed from the description of this movie as a ""spy thriller"". To my surprise, Hartley manages to make it worse with his well established style and focus to produce a highly original drama of international intrigue. It fails in more ways than one might imagine. Hartley's film misses the dialog and character focus that are his trademarks, along with an ugly singular cinematographic style.<br /><br />Moreover it is highly inappropriate given the current situation in the world and the state of war that has been fostered by dark elements on all sides. Hartley has brought all his skills to something so bad -- a political film worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as 9/11. Truly he is coming into his own on the top 10 worst list. The cast does a fine job of interpreting Hartley's vision and style. Fans of Parker Posey will see her in full bloom here, still with us and more sour than before."
Negative	This is one bad movie, I never want to watch it. Rauol Julia gave a horrific performance. Richard Dryfus is a talent in progress. It needed more of was Dana Delany, what a babe!
Negative	"Talk about a dream cast - just two of the most wonderful actors who ever appeared anywhere - Peter Ustinov and Maggie Smith - together - in ""Hot Millions,""but they ruined it for me forever. A sad, quirky comedy also starring Karl Malden, Robert Morley, and Bob Newhart. Ustinov is an ex-con embezzler who gets the resume of a talented computer programmer (Morley) and takes a position in a firm run by Malden - with the goal of embezzlement in mind. It's not smooth sailing; he has attracted the attention of his competitor at the company, played by Newhart, and his neighbor, Maggie Smith (who knows him at their place of residence under another name), becomes his secretary for a brief period. She can't keep a job and she is seen throughout the film in a variety of employment - all ending with her being fired. When Newhart makes advances to her, she invites Ustinov over to her flat for curry as a cover-up, but the two soon decide they're made for each other. Of course, she doesn't know Ustinov is a crook.<br /><br />This is such a bad movie - you can't love Ustinov and Smith and be fascinated by Ustinov's machinations, his ludicrous, and the ways he slithers out of trouble. There's a twist ending that will show you who really has the brains - no one. You can miss this movie, set in '60s London. But if you really want, it's worth just to hear Maggie Smith whine, ""I've been sacked."""
Positive	The director tries to be Quentin Tarantino, the screenwriters try to be Tennessee Williams, Deborah Kara Unger tries to be Faye Dunaway, the late James Coburn tries to be Orson Welles, Michael Rooker tries to be Gene Hackman, Mary Tyler Moore tries to be Faye Dunaway (older version), Cameron Diaz tries to get out of the frame as quickly as she can (successfully), don't ask about Joanna Going. And they actually pull it off. Eric Stoltz and James Spader try to present their joy with this stuff. It delivers thoughtful, meaningful dialog and very little action.<br /><br />Tulsa is a town with beautiful elevator lobbies, an art deco church by Bruce Goff and a lovely, sprawling mansion by Frank Lloyd Wright. Visit Tulsa, consider watching this movie. It doesn't do the location justice, but still worth it.
Negative	"I have been meaning to see this flick for the past few months. I was actually surprised at how disappointing it was.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a group of high school teenagers who are bullying a boy named Marty. They constantly bully him until one of them makes a horrific mistake which leaves Marty horribly burned.<br /><br />A few years later, the group of reckless teenagers are invited back to their own high school which is now abandoned for a party. Though, not one of the reckless teenagers has organized this party.<br /><br />Later through the film, the teenagers start dying in the most gruesome of ways possible. I can certainly tell you that they are cheap gory as well.<br /><br />At the end of the film, you find out it was all a dream and none of it happened. Duh! But, Marty is in the hospital with severe burns. Although the murders didn't happen, the burns and the pranks apparently did happen.<br /><br />The acting is terrible and that is not fine.<br /><br />I despise the story. I would maybe sympathize with Marty. It's nowhere like Tamara (2005). The bullies do get what's coming to them in the end but you end up feeling disgusted by the victim getting their ""sweet"" revenge.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend noone pick this up if you are looking for 80s slashers.<br /><br />I give this movie 2 stars out of 10. Horrid cheesy slasher!"
Negative	"This is a ""well"" directed film from John Cromwell who was is a great director but who did make some fine films including the 1937 version of 'The Prsoner of Zenda'. Set in a London that only Hollywood could manage, atmospheric but nothing like the real thing, it is a story of obsession and thwarted love, from the novel by Somerset Maughan.<br /><br />I was looking forward to seeing it on DVD as I had never seen it before and being a great admirer of Bette Davis wanted to see her in a role considered one of her early great ones. WHY IS THAT?. So I bought it. Well she looked fine but I'm sorry to say her London cockney accent just made me laugh. Bette Davis was one of the greatest film actors, make no mistake, but here she did not make it. It was impossible to take her character seriously. It wasn't as gruesome as the Dick Van Dyke 'Mary Poppins' cockney accent but close.<br /><br />In the other major role was Leslie Howard and he did it ok. He was a subtle and intelligent actor The supporting actors acquit themselves well. Watching this, even with Ms Davis' vocal gymnastics, is solely your choice."
