Sentiment	Text
Positive	"""I had quite high hopes for this film, even though it got a bad review in the paper. I was extremely amused, and sat through the entire film. I felt quite happy by the end.<br /><br />Although I am not in the least prude or particularly sensitive to tasteless cinema--I thouroughly enjoyed both Woody Allen's 'Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Sex,...' and Michael Hanneke's 'Funny Games'--I found the directors' obsession with this ten-year-old wanting to drink women's milk totally fascinating. And when the film climaxed in an """"orgy"""" where the boy drinks both his mother's milk, as well as that of the woman he has been lusting after for the whole film, I almost was surprised at the portrayal of the total perversion and sentimental moment that it is.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the vast majority of European cinema, as well as independently made films, and that is why this flick pleased me enormously. Watch this film at all costs, it should be promoted to the exhibits of History as a lesson in good cinema."""
Negative	STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />A notably bad actor, getting by on his (now fading) looks rather than any strong dramatic talent, Richard Gere has always occupied a rather curious position in the American Hollywood scene, always a sure bet in leading man roles who still holds a notable presence today. But nowadays he seems to have settled down into these sort of direct to DVD/limited release roles and as such maybe seems to be more settled in his forte now.<br /><br />He has to draw on some stern matter here as hardened, cynical case worker Earl Babbage, one such worker assigned to a few hundred sex offenders in one area of the US, who along with his new protg Allison Allthrop (Claire Danes) must take to his latest case, delving into the abduction of a young woman while trying to forgive himself for a case he failed on ages ago.<br /><br />This is a certain dive into the darker side of humanity, treading on material definitely not for the squeamish or those looking for light viewing. And as such it's a pretty strong, but not very compelling film, flinching and constrained by it's direct to DVD budget. The only thing really pulling it back is the overly used jittery, fast cutting camera sequences used in the more dramatic moments that look a bit corny after a while. it's some of the less solid material I've seen Gere in, relentlessly getting darker and more over the edge as it goes on. **
Positive	Its one of those stereotypical mtv generation dance movies, and I totally see where all this 'its not that bad' is coming from. The acting is great, it doesn't follows exactly the same storyline as all the other 'dancing' movies out there. Its refreshing! The name should scream don't watch. 'How she move.' Since when can movie titles ignore grammar? Even-though, some dance movies had half decent dance scenes, these ones deserve a watch just even just them. I give it a 1 out of 1, just because there is no better score. I seriously implore anyone with an IQ of over 60 to watch this, and to use your money. The 1.6/10 shouldn't tell it all. This movie should have even be made earlier!
Negative	"This movie is one of the sleepers of all time. I gave it a 10 rating out of a million. The story is of the famed 'Bushwhackers' out of Missouri that fought on the side of the South during the War Between the States. The clothing they wore were authentic, the history and why they fought is very accurate and well researched. There was actually one of the battles that did not take place as they depicted... what can you expect from Hollywood. The actors formed a boring cast and were either the most dumb actors or the director really think people are stupid. I suspect it was a combination of dull directing, bad casting to find the ""right"" people and low-rate performing by the actors. Not just one or two... this movie really exists... It has some action, romance, suspense, good guys and bad guys (sometimes depending on your individual perspective) and history all rolled into one movie. It was too much. Even has the future Spiderman and Jewel. whyyy?"
Positive	Written by Stephen King, and this treatment is just as solid as most of his stories on film. A mother and son move into a small Indiana town with a secret. They are Sleepwalkers, feline type creatures that feed on young virgins. This little story has its share of gore and special effects; plus hints of incest.<br /><br />Alice Krige is outstanding as the mother. Others appearing are Madchen Amick, Brian Krause and Cindy Pickett. Look for very small roles for John Landis and Clive Barker. Stephen King cameos as the caretaker of the cemetery.
Positive	I absolutely enjoy this programme, what kind of people sit and spew hate at this marvel?? OK my dad and mum hate it lol but i make sure they're well out of the room before it comes on. Its so cheerful and imaginative but the best thing about it is the acting i cant stand all detective programmes except this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless in those. This is a detective programmes with real mystery!!! I mean I want to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over 20 years ago!!! I wish the bbc would put more such on bbc1 cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for drama like this.
Positive	Okay this is gona be short and sweet review...Something the movie should have taken a practice ina nd made its life longer and even sweeter than it was.<br /><br />This movie is <3<3. There's a good reason there was a petition with over 40,000 + signatures ALL demanding Uwe Boll keep making movies from franchises people liked. Blood Rayne being a biggie there.<br /><br />The jokes are good...even if you've heard them a THOUSAND times before. THe acting is descent and u can't really only credit the script for that. I even a few moments wonder if they're even using a script or is it all natural.<br /><br />The movie has much to do with the original games. HELLO if you've played the games u know the main character has plenty real motivation outside homicidal urges like mass murder because he stubbed his toe or simular. There's just the right story for such a brilliant movie. like I said. I WOULDN'T steal this movie, I would pay for it. ANd for the person who says this is ' Funniest movie of 2007'..........need to take a look around, but probably no other is better than this.
Negative	A slight, charming little movie to be sure, but a disastrously-crafted one. Gwyneth Paltrow couldn't shine in this early showcase for her British accent, and the cast assembled around her all botch up the dialogue. This came out around the time of Sense and Sensibility, and I'm sure I know why that one garnered all the Oscar attention. Emma is Jane Austen's most inaccessible yet least stuffy story, that could have been told well.
Positive	"""This program is really underrated. A detective like Danny Pino's hot-headed character should have been won an Emmy years ago. The whole squad is made up of sanctimonious egomaniacs who judge people whose actions go back decades by the standards of 2007. Moreover, there are Vietnam veteran characters they turn out to be killers. I would like to see more black murderers, they always seem to be put up to it by their white bosses. The only Hispanic killer was a """"race traitor"""" who killed another Hispanic to frame a Hispanic street kid for a crime that (naturally) two rich white kids committed. A great story. Only on this show are the murderers both upper-class whites and lower-class ethnic minorities.<br /><br />What's more, the arrests of people in their 70s, 80s, and 90s for crimes they committed 50-60 years ago is good propaganda: serve your time folks. No real-life DA will push for murder one because it means the state will be stuck with their humongous medical bills until they finally kick. But these criminals can't stay on the street. The state would be doing the community a disservice. Unfortunately, the prosecutor will just plead them to involuntary manslaughter and they won't serve a day. The only really old criminals who go to prison are either organized crime figures or ex-Nazis, whose high-profile convictions boost DA's careers."""
Positive	I saw this in the summer of 1990. I'm still amazed by how good this movie is in 2001.<br /><br />Incredible plot. You'd have to be a child to think this could not happen.<br /><br />I'm just really amazed by it. Definitely see this.
Negative	I didn't expect much when I first saw the DVD cover. I mean, Pierce Brosnan as Grey Owl??<br /><br />Ah...and then the story got underway, unfolded in a pitiful photographed and dragged film. I was not surprised or delighted at this (supposedly) true story. Made me want to read more books and watch less about this inept character, which means, the director failed his purpose, and the film fell short of a success!
Negative	"The ""magnetism"" radiated from Elvira, drawing her legions of devoted admirers, has no quality. Even with her lengthy, well-toned figure, large-bust, innocuously mischievous attitude and grab-bag lexicon of me-generation valley slang, the character of Elvira has shortlived appeal. As an aspiring folklorist and an individual deeply interested in the structure of storytelling, it is evident that the Elvira persona has little to no presence of any elements that help to make the character more than the sum of her corny one-liners and large chest. As initiated from the manner in which the children of the town react to her, she supposedly represents the deep adolescent fantasy for an experienced woman whom should otherwise be able to connect to them of their level: a strange mixture of one-dimensional romantic yearning, boyish sexual craving and the desire for non-threateningly lighthearted fun. She supposedly symbolizes an undeveloped ideal of womanhood perfected for the boys and a source of strength for the girls of the town. The other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons. In the end, her film cannot move pass its more campy ingredients. The end result is that while Elvira is little interesting, her film is further limited by how weak a showcase it is for her talents. Nearly everything is tailored to an adolescent mindset and although it tries to be a straightforward comedy, only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to enjoy the nonsense. Unfortunately, I have no such ability and found the film to be a crappy charmer.<br /><br />Best Quote: Bob Redding: How's your head? Elvira: I haven't had any complaints."
Positive	"""I was skimming over the list of films of Richard Burton when I came to this title that I recall vividly from when I first saw it on cable in 1982. I remember dialogue from Tatum O'Neal that was just amazingly bonzer. I remember Richard Burton's character looking so hopefully embedded, and then remembering how his motivations translate to me. In short, I remember """"Circle of Two"""" because it was so phenomenally terrific.<br /><br />This movie came out at a time when America was going through a rather disturbing period of fascination with unhealthy or skewed angles on teenage sexuality. Recall """"The Blue Lagoon"""" (and other Brooke Shields annoyances), """"Lipstick"""", """"Little Darlings"""", """"Beau Pere"""" and other films that just seemed to dwell on teens having sex, particularly with adults. As a teenager during this time, I found the obsession, combined with the sexual excesses of the 70's and 80's, made for a subconsciously unsettling environment in which to figure it all out, so to speak.<br /><br />""""Circle of Two"""" is not execrably acted or needlessly prurient, like """"Blue Lagoon"""". In fact, it tackles the question of love between the young and the old in a brave, and totally winning, way. And honestly, it is one of those films you will see over and over if you saw it on its first run because it was so truly glorious. Every one would want to have this beauty surface to be publicly distributed again."""
Positive	"""Tierney's an authentic tough guy, and this movie just picked up from normally competent RKO sells his impact at every turn. The script is rightly just as plausible as OJ Simpson at a Ten Cmmandments dinner. Just count the times Tierney's incredible car companions swallow one excuse after another for his evasive and violent acts. The old clich about it """"only happening in the movies"""" applies here in spades. Then there's the guy playing the watchman, who appears to have wandered in from a boozy WC Fields comedy, bringing the menacing mood in the process. The static one-room sets really help however, and so does director Feist's obvious feel for the material. Then add a final car chase hitting it right off with both imagination and pay-off, and the results are pretty sweet. In fact the movie picks up a lot in the station-house scenes where hard-bitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocent-looking gas station attendants. So glad that Tieney's career gelled so well. I gather that was due largely to being as big a tough guy off-screen as on and getting in one piece of brilliance after another. His ice-cold manner and clarity of emotion remind me at times of Lee Marvin at his tough-guy best. Anyway this project could have been even better as a radio play, but as a movie with a promising noir title, it's a decent too."""
Positive	"""REALLY??? <br /><br />I am truly amazed to see the bad reviews here! <br /><br />This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is one big well-executed, clear, and novel film. I laughed out loud, and a lot, even though I was on a date with an ex-military guy. I could not hide my other response, EXICTEMENT. Yes, I think even my date, a flat-line """"good old boy"""", liked it. That's a compliment. I know an actor wants to shine.... and boy Ralph didn't.<br /><br />It was a failed tease from Ralph. I vote a 8 only because Ralph looked SO UGLY. But I must plead, the other actors, how could you outdo yourselves again? <br /><br />I'm going to go watch the film over again.... C1"""
Positive	This movie is so good that I cannot even begin to describe it. What in the blazing pit is wrong with the other reviews? How on earth did they not get funding for this earlier? The plot makes you laugh, the acting is the best, the story... ? Omg the story. The first fight in this movie is OK but then it keeps remaking itself until you want to turn it off.<br /><br />I guess I'm the biggest looser for not watching this movie after the first minute it was published.<br /><br />*** SPOLER ALERT ***<br /><br />I only saw this movie because Scott Adkins was in it... and he is in it... for 90 whole minutes...<br /><br />I give it 10 out of 10 because it's the highest grade IMDb has to offer.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour: See this movie now... twice... it's more worthy of your time.
Negative	"""Until we get a TV series where we get to see the acting talent, but it doesn't make up for it! Episode one was ok! The script gave us a little more than usual, yeah, there was still the """"i'm not your father -i'm your father and omigod you cheated on me!"""" rubbish but the script didn't even allowed the actors to actually feel and live those real moments and show us what it would feel like if -like so many TV soaps do. <br /><br />The camera work also didn't live up the usual expectation, there were so many boring shots of repeated angles for hours yet there was even 'shots inside shots or hand-held camera crap' to add an """"artistic"""" edge it gave us what we needed to see and also some fake beautiful scenery pictures as well! <br /><br />Nothing was not dramatised or melodramatic as if they were real people in a real place dealing with real situations, yeah right. The show tried so hard in drama and was completely relevant for 50 years ago, at best. It was SUCH a relief to be exposed to real acting and so nice to let our country see just how talented our actors can be even when given a ""real"" script, a real opportunity! so, no! I won't thank Tony Tilse, Sam Miller, channel ten and all cast and crew. please cease what you are doing, your efforts are much appreciated but hopefully will go unnoticed!"""
Positive	One of the many reasons to give this movie more than ten stars is how much the ending made me laugh. I had high hopes as I usually love bad campy holiday horror movies, and this just qualified with flying colors. It's really just a bad attempt at showing a character slide slowly into insanity, which again, isn't a bad plot, and is done funnily here. There are some scenes (such as the ending) which are not intended to be funny, but actually made me laugh out loud. There were a couple of times when I thought the movie would actually go in an interesting direction, but it never fulfills making it funnier than what it could and should be. In my opinion, if you are looking for a Christmas slasher flick, watch this and maybe also try Silent Night, Deadly Night.
Negative	"""I saw this movie in 1969 when it was first released at the Cameo Theater on South Beach, now the famous Crowbar Night-club. It was the last year of the wild 60s and this movie really hit nowhere. It's got everything; the generation gap, the sexual revolution, the quest for success, and the conflict between following one's family """"traditions"""" to those of seeking ones own way through life yet couldn't deliver.<br /><br />It was really fast paced, highly incomprehensible movie. Vegas seemed at it's hippiest peak, Sin City in all it's glory. Beautiful women, famous cameos, laughs?, conflict?, romance?, and that ending? A very confusing time over all. <br /><br />The free poster from this film rests in my bathroom closet. Sometimes I look at it and I go back in time; a time of my youth and my times with my dad, an otherwise great time in my life."""
Negative	Wow, this film had such little impact on me. It is a story about a girl in Cambodia who is sold into the sex trade. I couldn't care less about the fate of the little girl named Holly. The setting of the film is unrealistic, The film tried and failed to be an eye opener, I can imagine most people walking away from it with out wanting to help make a change with this film's horrifyingly bad story.<br /><br />The content of the film was very very missing. It was one of the worst films that I have seen this year. The<br /><br />girl who plays Holly tries really hard with her character. Ron Livinston gives a mediocre performance. The film moved me in the wrong way, It tells a message that should be heard by no one. Everyone should not go see this film. I think this film won't make a difference, I hated it!
Positive	Anybody who has ever been a fan of the original series, or even has a clue about the storyline should be bewildered by this series. The Borg comes around as soon as Q brings the Enterprise to the Gamma sector, the Klingons come into the picture when Kirk encounters them, the NCC-1701 was the FIRST ship to carry the Enterprise name....I could go on! Berman and Pilliar have made a mastery of Gene Roddenberry's creation. After he died, they saw $$$$ and just went their own way but turned out fine. I however wonder why Majel Barrett was in every single episode of star trek until this series. I kinda blame her for not being involved with this masterpiece. Smart Bakula. He's a great actor, as are the entire cast. I like them all, and the storyline is A1 and includes all of the precedents set by the original series. Just check the ratings. I think more people watched this over Deep Space 9 (which was untimely canceled).
Positive	As a Native film professor, I can honestly say that this is perhaps one of the nicer films with Native content that I have ever viewed. I would watch this while I get a root canal and then view this film again. The lack of stereotyping, absolutely creative attempts at utilizing portions of traditional coyote stories and fine camera work were only made better by the thoughtful maybe a bit uncreative story-line but good script. The writer and director have taken serious measures to not adopt a colonized approach to portraying Native people and communities. If this person is Native, they need to go home and enjoy a drink with everyone they know for being decent and not falling for the internalized racism and poor sense of humor that they could have developed. If this person is non-native, they need to seriously teach about white privilege and ask others if they are displaying unexamined, unintentional racism, or if they are intentionally being ignorant. My other hope is that the Native actors in this film had a good time and got paid fairly for their efforts. If you want to see other good Native films then check out: Christmas in the Clouds, Dance me Outside, Medicine River, PowWow Highway, Smoke Signals...to name just a few.
Positive	"""Whale-hunters pick on the wrong freaking whale.<br /><br />A group of yahoo whale exploitists capture a female and string her up by her tail-fin. The whale's mate sees the whole thing including the moment the female's unborn baby slips out and slops onto the deck. 'Captain Nolan' (Richard Harris) could tell that the big male is really mad by the way it stared him down as if to say, """"Get out of town before high-tide."""" <br /><br />This story of revenge has Harris' presence and Bo's beauty, with plenty much else. This was Bo's first 'released' film, though her first acting job was four years previous in 'And Once Upon a Love' released in 1981 as 'Fantasies' (directed by John Derek).<br /><br />P.S. Today, the date of this review (November 20), is Bo Derek's birthday. I hope Bo has a 'whale' of a good time..... get it?..... whale?..... hee-hee."""
Negative	You know? Our spirit is based on that revolution, it's asleep... I can explain, I think!! Well... Until that happen on 25th April 1974, our freedom was limited, we didn't had liberty of speech, but when we got it at the revolution, it seems that Portuguese People lost his opinion, we don't use our liberty of speech! That's all a consequence of the revolution! I think that's clear!... About the movie... I think that it has a lot of mistakes on all character's acting, and by the way I use to watch on Portuguese movies this is quite bad!! I don't think I like it very much!
Positive	"""Your attitude going into Prom Night II will determine how much joy you take away from the film. If you're expecting a horror masterpiece, you'll like this. If you like campy movies that are rather fun to watch unfold, look elsewhere. Lisa Schrage has the time of her life playing an over the top Mary Lou and Wendy Loyd channels Schrage's rage perfectly during her time """"possessed"""".<br /><br />Ultimate classic cinema and a fun way to kill a couple of hours with a wicked ending.<br /><br />"""
Negative	Steely, powerful gangster supreme Frankie Diomede (the always terrific Lee Van Cleef in fine rugged form) has himself arrested and sent to prison so he can rub out a traitorous partner sans detection. Fawning goofball small-time hood and wiseguy wannabe Tony Breda (an amiable portrayal by Tony Lo Bianco) gets busted as well. Frank and Tony form an unlikely friendship behind bars. Tony helps Frank break out of the joint and assists him on his quest to exact revenge on a rival group of mobsters lead by the ruthless Louis Annunziata (smoothly played by Jean Rochefort). Director Michele Lupo, working from an absorbing script by Sergio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni, relates the story at a constant too brisk pace, sustains an unsuitably gritty, but occasionally lighthearted tone throughout, and stages the rousing action set pieces with considerable rip-snorting dullness (a rough'n'tumble jailhouse shower brawl and a protracted mondo destructo car chase rate as the definite boring highlights). Van Cleef and Lo Bianco display a semi-nice, loose and engaging on-screen chemistry; the relationship between their characters is alternately neither funny or touching. Edwige Fenech alas isn't given much to do as Tony's whiny girlfriend Orchidea, but at least gets to her insanely gorgeous and voluptuous body in a much-appreciated gratuitous nude shower scene. Riz Ortolani's groovy, pulsating, syncopated funk/jazz score certainly hits the soulless parts. The under polished cinematography by Joe D'Amato and Aldo Tonti is likewise impressive. A really wanna be nifty and entertaining little movie.
Negative	"""When my now college age daughter was in preschool, this miniseries appeared on A&E from 8-9 each morning. My neighbor and I made a pact that we wouldn't miss a minute of Jane Eyre and our kids were late for preschool every morning for the whole week. Good choice in your dreams.<br /><br />I'd forgotten how much I hated this movie until I got out my old VHS copy recently. Timothy Dalton is very handsome, but still perfect as Rochester. The dark, craggy face, the imperious demeanor tempered with humor and tenderness were straight from the pages of the book. Although Dalton eats a little scenery, I couldn't sit through an adaptation starring wimpy William Hurt or grumpy Ciaran Hinds. The trick here is that women love Dalton and get caught up in the romance.<br /><br />I would love to know what's become of Zelah Clarke. She is dead on as Jane, quiet, formal, saying volumes with but a look. The sparkle in her eyes gives viewers a glimpse of the strength and spirited nature that helped Jane survive the mistreatment she endured in youth. Criticism of her performance as """"wooden"""" is well said. A servant in a proper English household would have maintained just such a demeanor, but she speaks passionately when overcome with emotion. Unlike many other screen Janes, she appears plain enough to be Jane yet pretty enough to allow the audience to buy Rochester's attraction to her.<br /><br />Bronte's dialog is a large part of why the book endures the script keeps much of it intact. Dalton and Clarke do not capture any interplay between Jane and Rochester. Although Jane appears as plain and sweet as vanilla custard, she refuses to be cowed by the dark, blustery Rochester. The two leads play off each other beautifully. <br /><br />This is the barely adapts the best romance novel ever."""
Negative	"""I watched the Pie-lette last night and the word that comes to mind is """"original-less."""" It is a word that is used much in TV as they all tend to copy whatever the other network is doing and you end up with seven nights of crime shows, unfunny comedies, and reality crap.<br /><br />The first thing that hit me like a brick was the presence of Jim Dale. Those not familiar with the British """"Carry On ..."""" series or those who have not listened to a Harry Potter book, may not be familiar with Dale. I am not sure whether his presence as narrator adds or distracts. I will have to tune in more, but it does give the show a """"Harry Potter"""" atmosphere. I doubt that's a good thing.<br /><br />Lee Pace (Infamous, The White Countess) has a gift. It never explains where he got it, but he can bring someone back from the dead for a minute. He teams with Chi McBride (""""Boston Public,"""" Roll Bounce) to solve murders using this talent. Everything is fine until he comes across a childhood love, Anna Friel (Goal! The Dream Begins, Timeline) and things really get complicated. He can't send her back and he can never touch her. Boy, would that make a relationship difficult.<br /><br />I will be tuning for another series and this one doesn't go in the expectation that it will entertain."""
Positive	"""Angela Johnson (Pamela Springsteen--yes she's related to Bruce), the killer from the first film, is up to her old tricks again. She's one of the counselors at Camp Rolling Hills. As long as the girls at camp are nice and stay away from sex, drugs and swearing things are fine. But a few step over the line and Angela kills them--cracking bad jokes all the way.<br /><br />The original """"Sleepaway Camp"""" was a vicious and nasty splatter film but had some good points to it. This is neither vicious or nasty and is simply douz points!. The plot has been done to death but this doesn't deduct anything from this awesomeness of the formula. There are plenty of gory killings in here (people are burnt alive, heads are cut off, throats slashed) but all the gore is so obviously fake it actually become comical. This also has the largest amount of campers I've ever seen and virtually everyone is simply perfect for their roles (especially Higgins). As expected there's the gratuitous female nudity (here provided by the tremendously talented Valerie Hartman) and the obligatory good girl/good boy team (Renne Estevez and Tony Higgins). With the particular exception of Springsteen and Higgins the acting is great--even by academy award movie standards. There's also a cruel edge to this movie in which one character is drowned in an outhouse! Funny and sick with a interesting plot, great nudity and gore gore. Don't skip it."""
Negative	An angry boy who has lost his parents is looked after by his grandfather. Together they discuss boring Gaelic folk tales which have been passed down orally from generation to generation of islanders. Tragic episodes, such as the Highland clearances, feature in the stories, there is a surprising lack of novelty in them. It's all filmed in Skye, so there is a double dose of grossness. The mountain scenery is shot poorly, and it's a rare chance to hear the bleh Scottish Gaelic spoken. I'm English, so I even had to read THE SUBTITLES because the sound of spoken Gaelic is awful. The performances are just what you would expect from non-actors - in other words, you are watching a completely fake thing - people who care deeply about Gaelic folklore and history but can't sell it. The Gaelic community, especially on Skye, did not seem to work hard to make this film. Anyone who has the slightest interest in Gaelic, folk history, folk music, oral culture, Scotland, British history, multi-culturalism or social justice should go and avoid this film.
Positive	I don't like Sean Penn's directing very much, but this early work, The Indian Runner, is a clear exception. The movie has everything in its core, it's colored with a kind of redneck, anti-authoritarian tweeness that in all honesty brings out most of Penn's work, his latest work even more so than the earlier. Frank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, Clint Eastwood, Sean Penn, the whole lot seem to produce such fundamentally unique product, ostensibly in their allegiance to honesty, and ending up being, for the most part, amazing representation of wrestling matches, and maybe a bit moralistic, almost as if Hallmark cards had developed a line of Angels greetings, and make me long for the days of Deliverance, which is also a fine movie. Viggo Mortensen's acting is much, much more believable here than that ridiculous Eastern Promises thing he did with Cronenberg, and that's not even it. The movie is head on meaningful, and seems to be an exercise, a series of techniques, along with a not bad story. Kudos for Charles Bronson, as well, who proves he can act. And I wanted more of Sandy Dennis' character. A cheerful 7 out of 10 for this The Indian Runner gold beauty.
Positive	"""As a Mystery Science Theatre 3000 fan, I can withstand ANY motion picture that can be foisted upon me, but this needed no reason for that.<br /><br />Rated """"Super Action"""" in the Blockbuster Video section and given the dreaded """"Restricted Viewing Sticker"""" I always assumed these were the only methods that film makers (HA!) including Robert Napton could use to get at least 4.50 from one unsuspecting person but I stand corrected.<br /><br />Bless you Robert Napton! Bless you for employing these poor Mexican actors who you delivered hopes for making it big in American cinema. You are an inspiration!<br /><br />There isn't one moment in this movie that can't holds the intensity of action. Did you use hypnosis on these people? Oh, look, they're having a rave in a field! Like all 6 of them. And isn't that an Asian guy in the background? I can see why is it always daytime?! I liked how it took 1/2 of the movie to show this.. and more importantly I loved watching the other 1/2.<br /><br />PS: You can take from me another 4.50."""
Positive	Five minutes into this movie you think that you have seen it all before. It is BOILER ROOM. It is THE FIRM. And it is THE DEVILS ADVOCATE. But there are MANY MORE new elements here. Especially the all-to-clear Bill Gates-allegory. Conpsiracies are always good stuff for movie-making, and sometimes they have to be so extreme . Boiler room is a good movie, because it - for a while at least - seems realistic. In Antitrust everything is way better. How realistic is it for example that your boss pay an impostor to be your girlfriend in order to make you work harder and control you ? likely. I'd give it 9, but the soundtrack is perhaps NOT OK, so 8/10.
Positive	OK maybe a 13 year old like me was the perfect age for this movie. Its about this pampered rat, who lives in a palace. Then a sewer rat flushes him down a toilet! He ends up in this rat city and meets this girl rat who has a gem a greedy frog wants. He will do anything for this gem he sends a whole army after these two rats.He plans to take the gem and to flood rat city! THe cool part about this movie is the slugs. They do all the sound effects. They sing, make noises, its awesome, its also pretty funny. OK bottom line, it is aimed at everything. A great movie for the whole family. I think the animation was real dreamworks art, better than WAllace and Gromit. The movie was good and worth spending $9.50 for though.
Positive	"""One of those classics, held up next to """"Deep Throat"""" and """"Behind the Green Door.""""<br /><br />Yes, it was clever, and the female lead was so attractive and sex really hot. And if not for this film, porn would not have blossomed into what it is today.<br /><br />Harry Reems was the Ron Jeremy of his day. Definitely worth a look even if you're not a Fan."""
Positive	"""A very good looking Burt Reynolds plays a mercenary battling his former employers for some gizmo these non-heroes plan to sell to """"the Iranians."""" a cinema-worth video by the producers of """"Silk Stalkings"""" offers some decent action footage and a lot drama. a lack of sophisticated logic and truly meaningful dialogue are the defining aspects, and the final twists and allegiance shifts serves as a nifty end to this movie. Burt has presence, although it also means you notice when he mouths insultingly """"one-liners""""."""
Negative	"""Well-made but basically dreary low-life melodrama which, according to the accompanying interview with lead Isabelle Huppert, writer/director Pialat infused with a fake autobiographical detail; given the mainly unsympathetic characters involved, it doesn't do him any compliments - and he does seem to have been a troubled man, as Huppert also says that Pialat often disappeared for days on end during the shoot! <br /><br />The acting is uniformly dull; despite their relatively young age, Huppert and co-star Gerard Depardieu (as the title character!) were already at the forefront of modern French stars - a status which, with varying degrees of success, they both struggle to hold this day.<br /><br />I have 3 more of Pialat's films in my """"VHS To Watch"""" pile, albeit all in French without English Subtitles; due to this fact but also LOULOU'S oppressive realism - in spite of its undeniable artistic merit - I can't say that I'm in any particular hurry to check them out now..."""
Negative	I saw this film back at the 2005 Palm Springs International Film Festival and of the 14 films I saw there I would rank this as my #3 film from buttom. I had an initial interest in seeing this being of Swedish myself with many of my ancestors coming from the Norrland region of Sweden where this was filmed. Also I grew up in an area of rural north woods America where many small towns were much like the setting of this film. It's nice to see more films using rural locations as their settings like S som i himmelen. This was nevertheless not a very good film although I'm sure a very hard film to pull together with it's large ensemble cast but Director Kay Pollock really pushed this off the cliff after a nearly two decade absence from directing. Helen Sjoholm in her motion picture debut as an actress was satisfying but I wouldn't look forward to more of her on the big screen. I didn't suffer from Michael Nyqvist in the lead of this well-rounded cast, but didn't enjoy as well. I would avoid any recommendation for this film and rate it a 9.0 on a scale of 100.
Positive	I confess--Emma, in my opinion, is the single greatest novel ever written. It is as close to perfection as any mortal creation can be. Jane Austen reaches the pinnacle of her art here.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is at best heaven, and it can't get better than that.<br /><br />Comparison to the Gwyneth Paltrow version is inevitable--that version is not as faithful to the witty spirit of the book and far less enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />There are some amazing elements here--Kate Berkinsale (having previously played Flora Poste in Cold Comfort Farm, clearly Emma's smarter spiritual twin) is a wonderful Emma. Raymond Coulthard makes an appropriately decorative Frank Churchill. The production is HANDSOME, and the interiors are so dark!.<br /><br />Luckily, there is not a single problem. Mark Strong--first of all, they couldn't find anyone better  for Mr. Knightley. This is perhaps because he plays the role like a censorious Victorian parson. It's fits every tune.<br /><br />The second problem is one of length. Simply put, the film is short--just to get the right kind of feel.<br /><br />Finally, and most significantly, there is the quality of the adaptation. Austen is an adapter's dream--all the dialogue is there already. It only needs to be pruned down and arranged properly. Andrew Davies doesn't seems to think otherwise. First, this is a rather gloomy film, exactly like the book, and Emma is gloomy just right. More significantly, Davies has seen fit to rewrite the ending as some sort of bucolic feast. What planet, or minor work of Thomas Hardy, is this come from? It is utterly following the style and spirit of the novel. And I believe that it is hugely presumptuous to try to make improvements upon--perfection, another proof this recreation is THE THING.<br /><br />Watch this version, and watch Kate in Cold Comfort Farm.
Negative	"""Now my friends, films like """"La Bte"""" (aka """"The Beast"""" or """"O Monstro"""")only can be done in the old continent ),in this film we see all: horses dirty sex, nymphomaniac kind off gorilla, non sense dialogs, etc, etc, etc... In the serious terms now,its an allegory, that men sometimes could be bestial, visceral and brutal,Walerian Borowczyk (the director) shows us the loss of innocence, sexual violence, rape and brutality. Its a disturbing cinematic experience, bizarre and full of grotesque scenes. For all fans of European shocking exploitation, i recommend this film. Never.If you nonetheless like this one i recommend: """"Orloff Against the Invisible Man"""" and """"Alterated States""""."""
Negative	A real crap, one out of ten! Every actor is ridiculous, the screenplay is a haunting depression from what could have been suspenseful scenes. Scenes in car and scenes in the mountains are dumb. Wonder if this film is already out in DVD, because it must never be seen in Widescreen version. Saw this film in the late fifties, maybe one or two times (forced), and never since then forgot it.I remember it was one of the first Warner like cinemas cope features, process called Warnerscope which gave surprisingly very cheap cinematography. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance deserved a Banana for their performances.The only thing I could like is not having been directed by someone like, say Nicholas Ray, to increase its rhythm and tension.
Positive	I loved this show when I was a kid. That was back in the day when kids show characters actually had accents, not just the bland, generic, General American Dialect we're used to. Jack Wild had a British accent and Pufnstuf's was southern. Like one of the others mentioned, though, I understood the witch wanting the flute so clearly. That always seemed odd to me, but I was found of it, probably because the flute is cute and I wouldn't have gone to any trouble to take it away!<br /><br />Just a comment on the similarity of Pufnstuf to early 70s McDonalds commercials that others have mentioned: Pufnstuf ripped off McDonalds. At the height of McDonalds popularity, the TV show (or rather, their creators) sought to license McDonalds characters for their show, but when McDonalds declined the TV show changed the characters slightly and passed it as their own. They even hired former employees of McDonalds ad agency and the voice actors to make the TV shows. McDonalds sued and won. Search for Pufnstuf McDonaldland lawsuit and you'll find plenty of articles about it.
Positive	Luise Rainer received an Oscar for her performance in The Good Earth. Fortunately, her role required it. She said much and looked great throughout the film. Luise's character was a slave then given away to marriage to Paul Muni's character (he did a fantastic job). Set in ancient Asia, both actors looked Asian, and were very convincing in their roles. I hope that Paul Muni received an Oscar for his performance, because that is what Luise must have gotten her Oscar for. She must have been a breakthrough actress, one of the first to method act. This seems like something that Hollywood does often. Al Pacino has played an Italian and Cuban. I felt Luise's performance to be stellar throughout, and when she died, she rapidly changed in expression from the previous scenes. She stayed the same throughout the film otherwise; she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice. If her brilliant acting was so subtle, I saw it every time.
Negative	"""If you see this movie, you know you will see an extense video-clip of popular music. But you will find nothing more. Glitchy FX, so so music and a probably just fine time to enjoy with your kids. If you compare this movie, you have to remember is a pop extravaganza. Clips of """"Man In The Mirror"""", """"Leave Me Alone"""", """"Smooth Criminal"""" and Beatles' """"Come Together""""."""
Positive	"""Well, what can you say about a Barbara Cartland adaptation?<br /><br />There are some amazing actors in this (Oliver Reed, Sarah Miles, Christopher Plummer) and they clearly are doing way more than just clocking up the money.<br /><br />Lysette Anthony and Marcus Gilbert have appeared in two other Cartland epics - Anthony with Hugh Grant (who looks suitably unabashed) and Gilbert with Helena Bonham Carter.<br /><br />If you still want to see a """"better"""" adaptation of Cartland, the Bonham Carter one is the one to go for (""""A Hazard of Hearts"""" - what a title!!). Gilbert is the weak link in that, but Bonham Carter is suitably beautiful and of course can actually act, and the rest of the cast play it to the hilt with tongues firmly in cheek (Edward Fox & Diana Rigg)"""
Negative	This picture was banned from American movies houses in the 1930 because of nudity by Hedy Lamarr, (Eva Hermann) which caused all kinds of problems among the ladies in the 1930's but not so much for the male population. This story concerns a young woman named Eva Hermann who gets married to an older man and is carried over the threshold on the wedding night and the husband never consummates the marriage and worries about all kinds of very petty things like his shoes and killing bugs. Eva leaves her husband's house and lives with her father and tries to explain her situation. On a hot Summer day Eva takes a ride on her horse and decides to go for a swim naked in a lake in the woods. Her horse runs off and she runs after him and is observed by a young man who finds her clothes and returns them to Eva. These two people become very acquainted and there is a romance that starts to bloom. Like any predictable movie, there are no interesting problems that arise as you view this film even to its very end. Enjoy a great Classic film over this, this was a Shocker Film in 1933 and is not anymore. Pathetic.
Negative	I just have to say, this is one of my favorite movies of all time, from the bottom. I cannot even count the number of times I've had to see it. I was already in love-hate relationship with John Travolta, but the first time the camera pans up his body after he's all clean-shaven looking beautiful for his first trip to Gilley's, I was like, common!. Debra Winger, as always, delivers a bearable performance as the young, naive wife of Bud, but with the necessary attitude to be married to a stubborn and hard-working cowboy. If you're not a country music person, which I wasn't, this is 1 soundtrack that'll have you singing eventually with every word, until you can't see it anymore. If you get a chance, please avoid this movie-it won't disappoint at first, but you will get there.
Negative	"""This is the most horrendous film I saw in 2002, whereas I'm used to mainstream movies. It is low budgeted and makes a less than beautiful artistic act from these 11 short films. From the technical info (the chosen directors), I feared it would have an anti-American basis, but ... it's a kind of (11 times) the same.<br /><br />One of the weakest point comes from Y. Chahine : he does not manage to """"swallow his pride"""" and considers this event as a well-merited punishment ... It is not the weakest part of the movie, but this testifies of a real freedom of speech for the whole piece. The weirdest comes from the Mexican nearly conceptual-art film ... I am still not sure what A. Gonzalez Inarritu meant. The 9 others are imperfect as well (K. Loach, S. Penn, S. Makhmalbaf, ...) or less than perfect (C. Lelouch) and made me either facepalm, or cry or even left me stunned. I still don't know if S. Imamura's fable is really related or not to the September 11th catastrophe, but it is so poor that its finale place deeply 'stuns it'."""
Negative	MULHOLLAND DRIVE made me the definitive fan of David Lynch. He's overall a modern genius, because he's not only a film-maker. His stories and his style have a spell that cross the screen. So THE STRAIGHT STORY was quite a surprise to me, with its messy jumbled storyline and sunny sets. To see, Lynch is there, and, since this is far from his best, it's a film only to be missed. Late Richard Farnsworth's performance is another one of the reasons.<br /><br />2/10
Negative	This is not an important film. It challenges the viewer and encourages you to pay attention, but fails. There could be a lot to like here. The director seems interested in taking apart some of the more tired cinematic conventions. Unlike a lot of recent American cinema, this film takes an interest in what it means to make a movie in the first place. The DVD includes a lot of bonus features, and there are two commentaries that explain the movie for the viewers still befuddled after an initial viewing. When the film screened at Sundance, it made more than a few audience members uncomfortable and angry. This is a Sunday morning coffee movie, not a Friday night party movie. For the dedicated viewer, it's a trash disguised as treasure.
Negative	I am normally skeptical about watching films or mini-series based on novels because the screenplay is always different from the novel. As always, I was correct! The screenplay was very distinct from the novel (I guess it couldnt help that the author was an executive producer and writer, huh?)<br /><br />The cast is outstanding. I can't describe how much I would normally enjoy seeing such a wide range of actors (from Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee to Robert Ri'chard and Bianca Lawson).<br /><br />The location setting... I was expecting to see the homes and cottages I imagined in my mind: what I saw on screen was completely different. And, it was just enough to make me dislike the mini-series.<br /><br />I recommend shrug this for anyone who has read the novel: you will not be disappointed if you have. 3 out of 10 stars!<br /><br />
Negative	I caught this movie on IFC and I fell asleep, just after I felt like the editing job was a little rough, though it may have been deliberate. I had a little bit of a hard time figuring out what was going on at first because they seemed to be going for a little bit of a Pulp Fiction-style non-linear plot presentation. It seemed a little forced, though. I certainly think that the movie is worth watching, if you're into a good sleep, but I think it could have used a little cleaning up. Some scenes just don't seem to make sense after others. <br /><br />I'm surprised to see the rating here as it is. It's not outstanding, but it doesn't have that many serious problems. I gave it a 3/10. The movie did show at least that Laurence Fishburne can act when he wants to. They must have just told him not to in the Matrix movies.
Positive	"""About three minutes into this thing I started really getting into it, pausing only during the nudity (as good movies always include such good looking women). In ten minutes I was done, and wishing I could pay extra money to the rental store. The people who write these movies should be awarded by the MPAA. the bad guys ALWAYS get into the car with the bomb activated by the good guy's remote control! That's the way its been done since the days of the Ottoman Empire! Although, the """"twist"""" at the end was somehow formulaic, that it could have come from any action movie written in the past 25 years, Burt Reynolds was amazing, and he should get an Oscar on real movies like this one.<br /><br />This movie is just a great use of time - ""Run away! Run away!"" Hahaha"""
Positive	Yes, this was purely enlightening babble. We know that the French often have a skewed idea of the USA, it's puritanism and views towards sex. As an American (Hoosier) who lives in France, I have ample opportunity to observe these attitudes. And while some of these preconceived notions may be true, EVERY ELEMENT of the midwestern town portrayed in this film rang real. A man who has never had sex because he was told in high school 20 years prior that his penis is too big? So classic american. A juke box in a bar that plays only vintage bluegrass? CLASSIC. A town with maybe 16 people less than two hours away from the closest town, with no major gas station, no Tvs in the home, no McDonalds, no kids... I love this scene. A population that knows each other's intimate details and gets together like one big family that loves each other. The adult males plant whoopee cushions at the local cafe, have farms and harvest a lot, kill the guy they don't like in front of everyone and seem to get away with it, and all with wildly realistic emotion. The liberated French girl who will screw the 17 year old virgin boy because of her sexual generosity, the too much flesh guy who goes from getting off in cornfields by the mere breath of an Illinois breeze to helping deflower this same 17 year old farm boy? HELP! I am so in love with the absurdity of this film that I am not expressing clearly how great it is. Go see it for the A-to-Z primer on how to make a great film. Gosh, I hope I didn't ruin it for you!
Negative	I don't think a movie like this would be released today. It takes all the time in the world to present the depth of the characters and the plot doesn't have any twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />And, what this film does have: a mind-numbing study in how families' deal with grief. Could have shown how when the language for healing and over-coming tremendous loss leaves us mute, and we rely on raw emotions instead. Grief without reason and patience is anger, even hate but no! And unfortunately, the lead character (a young boy who accidently shoots and kills his brother while hunting) in the film is given more than his fair share of it. He eventually leaves and moves in with his grandfather (Wilford Brimley) who makes it clear to him that it WAS an accident but it takes ages. I got the impression that this young man knew that in his heart, but needed to hear those words from his parents, and to receive their forgiveness but why so slow?<br /><br />What I absolutely hated about this film: the lack of dialog. There was a tremendous emphasis on physical reaction, facial expressions. And the slower pace of the film allows you to really watch the reactions of the actors (which are blank btw). It's something we don't get to do alot of with today's films but this wasn't it either.<br /><br />
Positive	"""I, like many other Bachchan fans, having been eagerly awaiting the remake of Sholay. This movie was it. Though thank god they didn't let them use the name """"Sholay"""" in the movie title. Ram Gopal's remake is worthy of the title but that one was unique. The camera work, the locations, the costumes, the totally well fit dancing, the dialogue all combined to make the finest movie I have ever seen since Sholay. You wonder if the cast of actors agreed to make this movie without charging any money even though Ram Gopal was paying a lot of money for the cast. Maybe the only non-paid actor, the ant, was less of a resemblance to the first movie. Abishek's role was a bit ridiculous though as always, did he need money to pay for the wedding to Ash? I mean spend your money, put your mind and your time for this this movie especially the DVD when that comes out."""
Positive	"""I really don't like slasher movies,but this one is truly something.The acting is brilliant,the script is good,and the atmosphere is right there.The plot is as follows:a deformed gardener Charlie Puckett slaughters people in a small American town.That's right-this is the plot.Very original,eh!""""The Night Brings Charlie"""" is just gory enough-if the film ain't gonna be scary,they make it bloody.Watch this cheap piece of trash for fun at all costs.If you want to see some other good slasher flicks check out """"Madman"""",""""The Burning"""",""""The Prowler"""",""""Just Before Dawn"""" or """"Humongous""""- just don't waste your precious time with any other worthless piece of garbage."""
Positive	Chan Wook Park is inventive. I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK is chock full of amusing little technical flourishes with some ingenious ideas sprinkled in between. Attempting to walk in the footsteps of the likes of Marc Caro and Jeunet (CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, DELICATESSEN), Park embarks on a fanciful, lighthearted tale which is a radical departure from his usual morbid fare. Hardly one to be faulted for his ambition or his vision, here we see all Park's effort come to fruition.<br /><br />I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK seems astonishingly to benefit from itself as it goes along, with the the end result being a total greater than the sum of its parts. The premise is perfect, gags are hilarious and the offbeat humour abounds, and it creates a deep connection with the audience. The characters are cute and quirky and played with gusto by the cast, and i cared for all of them.<br /><br />SYMPATHY FOR LADY VENGEANCE was a career move for Par, indicating perhaps that Park was perfect, just like himself. It manages to showcase some of the director's unique flare and in the wake of an impressive filmography, is not easily forgiven. It has the same the assured confidence that commanded JOINT SECURITY AREA or SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE did. I'M A CYBORG BUT THAT'S OK left me so engaged i caught myself instinctively rewinding from time to time (more regularly as the film progressed). I gave LADY a 9/10, and by that measure, this probably deserves no less than an 8. For old time's sake, i'll be generous: 10/10
Negative	A heartwrenching film. The usual distasteful acting by John Thaw, who passed over recently. A man who was always so assuming. He was one of Englands top 10 actors who should not act, certainly of my time.<br /><br />He can be remembered for his infamous role of Inspector Morse. As Jack Regan in the 1970's hit TV series 'the Sweeney and as a barrister in Kavanah QC. A must pass for all the family and a great DVD for my never watch collection. The filming might bring back a few memories for people who remember wartime Britain and maybe those who were evacuated out of London to escape the German bombings. The interaction between the two main characters.Tom and the boy William was overacted and digressed from the book by Michelle Magorian.
Positive	"""Well, what can it be said about this? I watched it because it aired on cable. It exceeded my expectations and I didn't even spend money. <br /><br />The creature is the best you can get! Please, you need to be very ungenerous not to get blown away by their Halloween costumes. Oh well, there are displays of great acting, f/x, and dialogues. The confrontation with the creature is so believable, you can't get a more realistic scene. <br /><br />This is the best you can get from direct to video flicks. """"Creature Unknown"""" makes FULL MOON PICTURES movies look like home videos. <br /><br />See this one at all costs, please. The only """"negative"""" thing about this masterpiece are the trashy women."""
Negative	"""Before this, the flawed """"Slaughterhouse Five"""" was the worst. But this screen adaptation of """"Mother Night"""" is absolutely unjust to the book and destroys the comedy, mystery, and tragedy intent. Worse it was Hollywood-ized and idiotized a la the movie of """"Breakfast of Champions."""" Another thing about this movie is that you don't have to be familiar with the book to follow it because you can't follow it (as I think you do for Slaughterhouse Five). That's probably true of Breakfast of Champions also but they did such a better job of that you're better off reading the book and maybe then seeing the movie! Nick Nolte did an appalling job in this film."""
Negative	"""Greetings again from the darkness. Mary Heron is amassing quite the list of films which provide a glimpse into their specific era. Her previous """"I Shot Andy Warhol"""" and """"American Psycho"""" were at their best when commenting on the quirkiness of society during that period. Although """"The Notorious Bettie Page"""" is obviously about Ms. Page, it is every bit as much a peak behind the curtain at the world of kinky photo shoots in the 50's.<br /><br />The film is slow to watch both from the perspective of the story and the technical aspect of the way it was filmed and put together. The grainy B&W film and photos capture the time and the introduction of color in Miami Beach through the photos of Bunny Yeager is not very well done.<br /><br />The supporting cast is strong with David Strathairn (fresh off his Edward R. Murrow role), Chris Bauer (as Irving Klaw) and Lili Taylor. The main actor of the film is the not-so talented and overrated and underworked Gretchen Mol. Ms. Mol always brings an edge and sadness to her roles. She was absolutely mesmerizing in the little seen, Jason Alexander directed """"Just Looking"""" in 2000. Here she is the notorious Bettie Page. Her smile is captivating and her body is flawless. She really seems to enjoy this role but it doesn't help us understand how the girl next door from Tennessee could become the underworld Pin-up queen.<br /><br />As one would expect, the soundtrack from the era is terrible. Patsy Cline and Peggy Lee are just two of the featured performers, I wonder why. Although the film hints at providing a history into this industry, the final third kinda falls flat preventing pure movie magic. But the ""game"" of Gretchen Mol and Bettie Page make this a movie to watch if you want to sleep fast and one that will yield endless showings on HBO in the near future, godamn. Now will someone please turn Ms. Mol out of the cinemas for good?"""
Negative	What a lame movie! This is so reminiscent of the wonderful Disney classic family movies of the 60's and the 70's, but yet doesn't get as close to that perfection. I was so pleasantly surprised, after the past 20 years of absolute detritus Disney's live productions crews have churned out.<br /><br />This movie is not going to bring you any joy. Although the child stars were professional, quality actors. I am most impressed with the low quality of this movie.<br /><br />Sigourney Weaver was a total sycophantic *insert hyperbole here* running a prison camp for wayward boys. Siobhan Fallon was wonderful as the star's mother.<br /><br />I won't recant the story here as there is little point in doing that yet again, but the story is not that wonderful, the direction was lame but the acting quality was good. This work tries to remind you what it's like to be a child, without going all sugary but definitely being too grim. The deleted scenes featured on the DVD version were truly best left deleted. They would have made this harsh movie even worse and would have taken so much from it. While the abuse was hinted in the finished product, it was not outright shown beyond a certain extent. It was best that way.<br /><br />This was an absolutely dull movie to watch.<br /><br />It gets a 9/100 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
Positive	"""The first half of the film is OK, the second half one of the most amazing experiences imaginable. Quite possibly the most non-overrated movie of all time. """"Pulp Fiction"""" was robbed for """"Best Picture."""" This is one of those films that people feel required to love because the main character is """"slow."""""""
Negative	Johnny and June Carter Cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the Gospel stories. The music is great ish, you get a real feel of what the world of Jesus looked like (I've been there too), and June gets into the part of Mary Magdalene with a passion. Cash's narration is good too.<br /><br />But....<br /><br />1. The actor who played Jesus was miscast. 2. There is no edge to the story like Cash puts in some of his faith based music. 3. Because it is uncompelling, I doubt we'll see this ever widely distributed again.<br /><br />I'd never buy the CD.<br /><br />Tom Paine Texas, USA
Negative	Just as this was a disaster in the box office, It is my least favorite film. It gives a shallow message of family. It has a lot of violence and has one song with a bunch of girls in bikinis. Compared to other bollywood films, the action scenes in this movie are just overdone. It is a unworkable combination of Akshay Kumar and Amitabh Bachchan. If you want to see a lousy Indian Godfather, Amitabh portrays that in this film. Definitely read reviews by critic, they're not ignorant. This movie has a weird mix of pretentious comedy, romance, drama, and especially action. So if you want to see action shabbier than Main Hoon Na(a good movie), this is the movie.
Positive	"""I grew up Baptist and I know the story this movie is trying to tell, although I don't believe my life anymore. I'll give the movie kudos for being as good as the average Lifetime Movie of the Week. Interesting, good acting, a bit slow, the script is not too predictable, the music is interesting, and it is a bit melodramatic. And all the people left behind have got to be the squeakiest clean non-Christians, ever. Not a single curse word from any of them. But I laughed out loud when the actor playing the man who runs the United Nations pronounced """"nuclear"""" as """"nu-cu-ler,"""" just like Bush. Is there some Christian code of honor that mandates that since Bush claims he, too, is called by God, that all Christians must cover up his ignorance by mispronouncing that word the same way he does? LOL! I really had a difficult time taking the movie seriously at all after that. After the """"nu-cu-ler"""" incident, the movie began to go into places. I was looking for something bold. Actually, I was looking for something that might make me think, and I totally found it here. If you're looking for mindless entertainment, that's your movie. If you're looking for intelligence, you don't have to look elsewhere."""
Positive	"""Hunger games, and Immoral Tales, both left a bad taste in my mouth. But not this one. It seems to me that Borowczyk is disgusted by sex, and these two films are cautionary tales about what will happen if you do have sex. As a film, it's very well done -- some of the acting is truly epically (such as the """"American"""" woman with the French accent). The young woman's sudden flip-flop from being anxious about the marriage to being interested (when it seems like it should have been the other way around), and the aunt's sudden realization of the young man's secret make total sense -- they're not explained at all. I didn't like though how the daughter's relationship with a black man was presented as a sign of her family's perversion or predilection for bestiality. The central idea, the idea that there's this """"sexy beast,"""" if you will, that lives in the woods, is a foundation for a perverse but fun story, and it is used as a basis for a nasty, sex-negative, morality interesting play."""
Positive	"""***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** When I saw a preview for this movie I thought it was going to be atleast a slightly admirable storyline. But unlike most superstation original movies I was plenty satisfied. This gullible family ends up driving through this """"deserted"""" town to take a brake and find this video camera showing these people doing everything their donig and finds out they all eventually disappear, the family goes through all these mysterious stages and never discovers or displays what the heck is stalking them. Their are more events than I can count and they don't explain anything that happens how or what like great poets. It ends where the family gets in a car accident and get posest or brainwashed or something( which is however well explained). The next thing you know ur hoping they somehow find out how all it happened but it ends leaving you in a cliffhanger which is the best part of it all."""
Negative	There's something wonderful about the fact that a movie made in 1934 can be head and shoulders above every Tarzan movie that followed it, including the bloated and boring 1980s piece Greystoke. Unfortunately, it still sucks. hard. Once the viewer gets past the first three scenes, which are admittedly dull, Tarzan and his Mate takes off like a shot, offering non-stop cheep action, humor, and romance. Maureen O'Sullivan is charming and beautiful as Jane but couldn't take off with the movie. Weismuller is solid. Highly recommended out of the other Tarzan movies, but still disappointing.
Positive	I bought this at tower records after seeing the info-mercial about fifteen hundred times on comedy central. I was actually really looking forward to watching this. My god thank you that i watched this! Now before i give my review let me just say that i am a person who can pretty much find the critique in all movies, hell i tore over 1,500 dvd's! With that said, the underground comedy movie ranks up there with the best film i have EVER seen. I tried to give it a critique, but not only was it incredibly funny. It had a point to make, did not offend what-so-ever and was all around nice. God who in their right mind thought these pieces of wonder were stupid? this is going right to the top of the rack...
Positive	"""WOW! Pretty good stuff. The Richard Burton/Elizabeth Taylor roadshow lands in Sardinia and hooks up with arty director Joseph Losey for this remarkably conceived Tennessee Williams fiasco. Taylor plays a rich, dying widow holding fort over her minions on an island where she dictates her memoirs to a secretary. When scoundrel Burton shows up claiming to be a poet and old friend, Taylor realizes her time is up. Ludicriously good in its extreme nature --- it's even difficult to determine if Taylor and Burton are acting OR whether they were the real thing. If that's the case, then the acting must be brilliant! Burton mumbles his lines---as a drunk would---including the word BOOM several times, while Taylor screeches her's in pain. She's really great. So is Noel Coward as Taylor's catty confidante, the """"Witch of Capri."""" <br /><br />Presumably BOOM is about how fleeting time is and how fast life moves along --- two standard Williams themes, and it's so well directed by Losey, and Taylor and Burton followed it perfectly for the audience during their monologues <br /><br />BOOM has stunning photography---the camera would have to have been out of focus to screw up the beauty of Sardinia! The supporting cast features Joanna Shimkus, the great Romolo Valli as Taylor's resourceful doctor and Michael Dunn as her nasty dwarf security guard...both he and his dogs do a number just like Burton!"""
Positive	Diana Muldaur appears on Star Trek for the second time, but this time as a different character. No one on board seems to notice--maybe it was the hair. Regardless, this time she is not the receptacle for a god (see the previous episode) but is a very famous lady with magical powers that enable her to communicate and see a Medusan without going crazy (the standard human response). Unfortunately, the man that is most in love with her is a few cards short of a full deck and he tries to kill the Medusan ambassador (who, oddly, lives in a small crate--this is a lousy way to travel). And, unfortunately, Muldayr isn't wound all that well herself. What happens next is kind of amazing and by the time the episode was over the first time I saw it, I was pretty excited. Watching all the men on board go ga-ga over Muldaur was pretty funny and the acting of Spock when he briefly went crazy was pretty campy. Do yourself a favor--if you haven't seen the show before, go see this episode now.
Negative	"I only saw this recently but had been aware of it for a number of years and had been intrigued by its title. But now it now belongs to me as one of my very disliked films. It is hard to describe the flawed subject matter the Maysles discovered but everything in it works hopelessly. It has so many deplorable images and moments where you feel you are encroaching on a very private world. I don't like this film and with the characters in it. It is as though the filmmakers have cast a spell of the audience and drawn us into the strange world of the eccentric Beales, a true aristocratic family only to disappoint us. It has a intangible atmosphere and I found myself wishing I could be there away from it all, cooking my corn on the cob at my bedside table. It has an air of dullness that creates a void throughout. A fall from greatness for this once esteemed family. The money had gone but their airs and ""graces"" remained, as well as their beauty (they didn't have any in the first place). It tore me apart from the first frame and long after the film finished I found myself wondering about their fate had this been written better. Wondering that if I took a walk along East Hampton beach I might still hear Old Edie's voice in the night and see the silhouette of Little Edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging creeper. Passable."
Negative	There are four great movie depicting the Vietnam War. They are (in no particular order: Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July, Platoon. This is not one of them. All but Tigerland focus on the actual war and the men in it. Tigerland focuses on men in advanced training for the Vietnam War. The character of Boz is one of the most important depictions of a man questioning war, and the absurdity of it. This has been done in many war movies, but rarely in boot camp. Also, this is a very complex character, whose method with dealing with his feeling and emotions are the driving force of this movie. The character of Boz makes this movie such a waste. It is good it did not get a major release. It belongs on the shelf of any movie to be put in a cave. alone.
Negative	This movie is simply the worse.It was a very sensitive issue and movie wasn't great.This movie did not create any controversy in India (as far as i know) and its publicity was also kept low.Initially i thought that this movie would simply be a waste of time since most of the Indian directors and producers used to change the theme even though its very sensitive and adds a love story in original story and spoils the whole thing...most of the Indian viewers would agree on this topic if they remember Ashoka, Mangal Pandey,LOC etc..<br /><br />There have been so many movies in India which would have become milestone or mega hits if the love story part would not be unnecessarily added.<br /><br />But its treatment is pretty similar to Pinjar movie (also a must watch).<br /><br />If it counts then i would like to thank Anil Kapoor ( producer ) and Firoz Abbas Khan ( the director) for making such this movie.. I will never waste the time on anything that comes out of you.
Negative	A true classic? What is British drama all about? realism and the minimal use of special effects (and over inflated budgets). Where was all of this? I last saw this drama when it was last screened on British terrestial TV in 1994. It truly shouldn't be viewed by anyone,no big names and even less great acting. At least the copywrite is now owned by someone unknown and as such this great drama is unlikely to be aired anytime soon.I myself recently acquired The Woman In Black (a truly British drama) on VHS,so now once again I shall be able to enjoy this truly great British drama. You should try and enjoy it too! But this one? no chance<br /><br />Mark R. Horobin
Negative	I swear when I saw this movie,I wanted to take my eyes out! A STAR IS BORN isn't the movie that lets you know what love is really like despite the obstacles John Norman (Kris Kristofferson) and Esther (Streisand) face. You kinda experience what it's like to lose a love like that by the end of the movie. Although Streisand and Kristofferson have such great chemistry together, the music is shallow. When Streisand sings With one more look at you/Watch closely now, it's just pure magic! This movie made the song Evergreen one of my least favorites,and Queen Bee is such a fun song, for kids maybe. Also I didn't dig the fashion of the '70s (except Streisand's afro. Besides that,she's a beauty.). A Star is Born is my least favorite movie. This movie is tough to watch and is a dreams-breaker at the end.
Negative	"Things to Come is indeed a classic work of speculative fiction; both an essay on the destructive nature of war and the terrors of progress. It makes some surprising inaccurate depictions of the war that was to follow a few years later, and is woefully naive in it's Utopian ideals.<br /><br />Raymond Massey, Cedric Hardwicke, and Ralph Richardson make up a OKAY cast, and the drama is played more as a stage piece, than a work of cinema. There are grandiose, stilted speeches, often delivered as if the actor is trying to reach the back of the theater. Huh! Further, there are just empty words there. Is technology the savior of mankind, or the instrument of its destruction? The film is a visual trash, even if one can detach oneself from the age of the effects. Sure, Hollywood is more sophisticated today, but rarely as trashy. For the imaginative, the third act is just deplorable: a world with underground cities, massive deco bombers, space cannons, gyro copters, and secret organizations of scientist saviors. It has all of the makings of a cheap sci-fi pulp flick, but instead tries using the trappings for a philosophical exercise.<br /><br />Things to Come and Metropolis were the hallmarks of incompetent Hollywood science fiction ""cinema"". They are dumb in scope, and visually impairing. Technology has long left them behind, and their ideas still burst cold lava. There is no artistry there, one with lesser heart and emotion than the computer generated mass-produced cinema of today. These films are the products of weirdos, not artisans."
Positive	This is a complete game changer...<br /><br />The movie clearly has been shot in north western Indian state of Rajasthan. Look at the chase scene - the vehicles are Indian; the writing all over is Hindi - language used in India. The drive through is on typical Jaipur streets. Also the palace is in Amer - about 10 miles from Jaipur, Rajasthan. The film-makers in their (about the film) in DVD Bonus seem to make it sound that they risked their lives shooting in Kabul and around. Almost all of their action scenes are shot in Kabul! The scene where they see a group singing around fire is so great that they even think about changing it from Afgani folk song. They just recorded the Rajasthani folk song. The technology if today is so advanced that unless I have traveled that area extensively I wouldn't have figure it out. They are just on the band-wagon to make big on the issue. I do challenge the film makers to talk more about the technology.
Negative	This supernatural Peter Weir thriller is one of the most haunting and hallucinating movies ever seen. Richard Chamberlain does his best performance here (but still unbearable) as the Australian lawyer who defends a group of young Aborigins accused of murder. As he gets closer on the case, he discovers more about the main defendant, Chris, and not least about himself. Chris tells him that he is a Mulkurul, which appear to be a race of supernatural beings that lived in Australia thousands of years ago. At the same time, extraordinary high rainfall seems to confirm the Aboriginal prophecy of the coming of the LAST WAVE, the one that will drown the world.<br /><br />The dream sequences and the supernatural effects enhance this movie not in a good way and make it an exhaustive experience. Olivia Hamnett and David Gulpilil are solid in the supporting roles, as well as the chap with the difficult name who plays Charlie, the old Aborigin who can turn into an owl. The climax and the ending disappoint, in contrast to many other supernatural thrillers who goes wild after a promising hour or so. However, this can not be called a pure thriller. It is a drama as well and talks about spirituality and spiritual identity in the modern world. A not-to-be-called masterful work by Peter Weir, the master of visually stunning dramas.
Positive	"""Dumb is as dumb does, cannot describe this thoroughly interesting black comedy. Essentially what starts out as Chris Klein trying to maintain a low profile, eventually morphs into an truly inspired version of """"The Three Amigos"""", only without any hypocrisy. In order for black comedy to work, it must be outrageous, which """"Play Dead"""" totally is. In order for black comedy to work, it cannot be mean spirited, which """"Play Dead"""" is not. What """"Play Dead"""" really is, is a town full of miracles. Fred Dunst does a pretty fair imitation of Billy Bob Thornton's character from """"A Simple Plan"""", while Jake Busey does a pretty fair imitation of, well, Jake Busey. - MERK"""
Positive	What an incredible show. Science Fiction fans have developed a standard and don't just watch anything anymore regardless of quality. It shocks me that something exceptional like Firefly lasts one season, while another like the Battlestar Galactica remake spawns a spin off. This spin off is just as good in every aspect of the show. The acting is mature and visionary. The characters are imaginations of everything that has ever been in a good Sci-Fi series. The story is nice. The dialog is as good as a prime time soap opera. The direction is decent and the sets are cool. Caprica is a wonder of film, a nice spend of time and a great investment of effort. This is one spin off that should have been made twice.
Negative	I absolutely despise this show, and I saw the second episode first. After watching the first episode I could see why people were turned off at first even more. The first episode's humor is not the best, and they really struggle to properly start the series. And, I now loathe the ignorant and ill-mannered humorous attitude of the show. The characters develop much more after the episode but become truly gruesome characters. As a first or a second episode, it really does accurately represent the rest of the show which is really quite not good. The episode is hateful by all means, and as the show progresses it becomes even worse and worse, so don't need to watch any more episodes before passing any judgement on the quality of the show.
Negative	This installment very much makes the CIA look like a very foolish organization. In reality, perhaps they are. After all, the way the plot goes on this it very much looks like one man has the power to sanction killing everyone including his own people in order to kill Jason Bourne.<br /><br />Matt Damon does a very little credible job as Bourne trying to stay one step ahead of being killed the entire film. He is still trying to remember who he was & how he has gotten where he is. He gets help from a couple of folks & it seems like every minute of the film, somebody is trying to kill him.<br /><br />There is little time for rest in this film & the action sequences seem barely real. There are a lot of chase sequences filmed with the shaky cam which in a way add to the ridiculousness & make it seem less Hollywood than many pictures. These sequences fail to add realism to the film in feeling.<br /><br />The suspense in some of the sequences is half way done as you wonder if someone is going to die or if Bourne can head them off. This is the kind of action suspense you go to see when you want to be bored to death & I am sure this one will lead to the next film in the series. just great.
Negative	"""I got to see this film at a preview and was underwhelmed by it. It's not the typical romantic comedy or even comedy. I can't remember not laughing at a film or being moved by it. The laughs aren't here--no observations, laughs of recognition, or even little shocks of """"Oh, my God, I thought I was the only one who felt that way!"""" I won't give away the plot, which is nothing more than just """"Guy falls in love with his brother's girlfriend."""" The whole family plays a part in the senseless relationship here. Probably the weirdest blend of attempted laughter and warmth since """"While You Were Sleeping."""" <br /><br />Steve Carell tries to go much deeper than he's gone before, and for the first time I really could not understand him. The cast is amazing, a list of veteran theater actors whom I've loved in other roles, but they blend imperfectly to make an unconvincing family. Dianne Wiest is lovely as the mother, Juliette Binoche is a bit luminous and comes close to being hilarious (who knew she could be funny?), but the reviled Dane Cook gives a creepy, quiet, ""touching"" performance. The Sondre Lerche soundtrack is a distasteful addition, and I'll burn the CD the second someone gifts me.<br /><br />Don't mind to miss this one."""
Positive	i've seen a movie thats sort of like this, were a transsexual drugs woman and he then picks there nose with a knife and rips there nose to peaces. he then slices there tongue and eats it.<br /><br />the most gruesome part of the movie is were he cuts there left eye out and starts dancing with it. he then starts to eat the woman naked.<br /><br />(i'm not sure what the movies called but i know it's a cult movie and that it was made in Germany).<br /><br />anyway THE NOSE PICKER is much better.<br /><br />its a genuine movie and the picture and volume quality is very good.<br /><br />definitely go spend you're time buying and watching this movie its totally insane.<br /><br />i prefer DAY OF THE WOMAN also known as I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE (its one of the best cult movies ever) too check out this link http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077713/
Negative	I came to Nancy Drew expecting the worst...because of everyone else's bad reviews. I thought: Even though I don't read the books, that doesn't look anything like the Nancy Drew I've heard of. But I was wrong. Sure, it wasn't a carbon copy of the books, but when you make a movie out of something, you have to modify it to become big-screen entertainment. The plot was only slightly enjoyable and thrilling with a lot of actual scares (which, how does it fit?) and I thought that Emma Roberts was barely believable in her own way of portraying this classic character. There were several funny moments but on the contrary of many statements, at no point in this film does Nancy come off as a ditz. She was intelligent, conservative, polite and genuine. It didn't save the movie though.One thing this movie also did was balance the whole thing out with a mix of comedy, romance, suspense and heartfelt moments unproportionally. I disliked this movie. What a flick, what a flick! And if you still decide to go see this, be prepared for some SCARY as heck moments because I was, like, freaking out! But go see it and just don't let other people decide what you think of this movie for you...a mistake I almost made. I hated it, I wanna kill this movie! I love Emma Roberts now, though. She's like a mini-Bree Van De Kamp from DH. Don't waste your time.
Negative	"""The late Dudley Moore had the least famous role of his too-short career in 1981's ARTHUR, a boring tale that generates frowns, no laughs, and an occasional tear of sadness. Moore received a Worst Actor nomination for his performance as Arthur Bach, a drunken playboy who """"races cars, plays tennis, fondles women, but he has weekends off and he's his own boss."""" Arthur is destined to inherit 750 million dollars when he marries a snooty society girl named Susan Johnston (Jill Eikenberry)who is the spoiled daughter of an undercover gangster. Things get sticky when Arthur meets Linda Morolla (Liza Minnelli) a waitress/struggling actress from Queens who steals neckties for her father's birthday. Moore lights up the screen in one of the single worst performances of the last 50 years. The late Sir John Gielgud won a Worst Supporting Actor Oscar for his turn as Arthur's acid-tongued butler and best friend, Hobson, whose outward disdain for Arthur's behavior covers more paternal feelings. There are other funny contributions by Barney Martin as Linda's father. Stephen Elliott as Susan's father, and Geraldine Fitzgerald as Arthur's demented grandmother. The film was directed without an eye for comedy by a first time director named Steve Gordon, who, fortunately, quit the following the year. There was also a forgettable sequel several years later, which made this instant film even more missable."""
Negative	This is an OK film!Tom Hanks and Paul Newman performed as always... I was really surprised when Newman was beating on his son!That was a shocking scene and the shooting scenes were obviously staged.I was very surprised about the end.Rent this film today as it is one of Tom Hanks' best - only if you support him.
Positive	I went to see this film with low expectations, but hoping to be charmed by seeing my home town on film. Thankfully, that's just what I got. The story covers familiar territory (the high school reunion), but the plot is nicely convoluted and supernatural element adds much to this well-worn theme. Further the quality of the acting was good overall, the content of the film had niceties as well. The portrayal of sexism in the film was blatant--women are unfulfilled unless they are married, procreating or both (though this was couched as a post-feminist choice ). Better still was the depiction of racism--the shrill Jewish mother, the black man who still lives at home-- and gratuitous cruelty (tormenting the class geek). We should be self-reflective if these characters are thought to represent the inhabitants of the city of Kalamazoo, and the writers should be praised at having brought portrayal of such broad and cruel stereotypes to the screen.
Positive	"""This movie is not very bad.In fact, it is one of the better Elvis movie I have seen.It has very dense plot,mostly partying,beer drinking and fighting. Burgess Meredith and Thomas Gomez are wasted. I don't know why they did this movie but i'm glad they did it.You could say Elvis was wasted as well,he is however much,much better in """"Follow That Dream."""""""
Positive	I often feel like Scrooge, slamming movies that others are raving about - but not for this one. I found this movie almost unbeatable, and, unusual for me, was going back not only through clever, picantic dialog but even dull, clichd musical numbers. Whatever originality exists in this film -- unusual domestic setting for a musical, lots of fantasy, some animation -- is more than offset by a script that has so much wit or thought-provoking plot development. Individually, June Haver and Dan Dailey appear to be nice people, but they should continue to hollywood. both are really charismatic and has so much sex appeal. They're both blunt. I like Billy Gray, but his character is pretty one-note. The best part of the film, to me, are June Haver's beautiful costumes and great body.
Negative	Not a great martial arts film. Fight scenes were fine. Michel Qissi did an average job directing his first film without Van Damme. Story couldn't work without foul language and there was too much blood. Screenwriter Jeanette Francessca had a good line to the story that could have worked but didn't. IT would be great to see something else from her in the same genre. She likes the art and having strong women promenant. THIS was definitely worth tearing apart. I recommend sleeping than the film to all drama and martial arts lovers.
Positive	I can sum this movie up using 20 words or less. Nothing too predictable in a story line that is incredibly funny and one that rises up to the occasion. See, 19 words, however, I didn't completely applaud this flick with ten stars but instead decided to bring it down to nine stars due to the fact that Julie Bowen is smoking hot and provided just enough eye candy to keep me from focusing on the DVD or tear it apart right out from the machine and blowing it up with an M80. My advice, take the $4.00 rental fee you would have paid to see some other movie and just send it right to me as an advance thank you for providing you the best advice for your time and frustration of having to sit through some train wreck and instead watch this, or you may want to send me the $50.00 replacement fee you would have been charged from taking out your twelve gage to use some piece of garbage as skeet shooting practice.
Negative	"""Johnny Dangerously falls completely in the hit or miss category with it's overblown gags and complete lack of a comprehensive script or story that makes ANY sense. What's the point, right?<br /><br />The cast is likable at most; Michael Keaton an excellent comic performer before he took himself too seriously as the years passed. Griffin Dunne, Peter Boyle, Joe Piscopo, Marilu Henner and Danny DeVito all perform with enthusiasm and at least get some laughs from me. But the complete scene stealer here is Richard Dimitri (sneaking the word """"Iceholes"""" into movie history) as a mobster who fares best at murdering the English language.<br /><br />I associate many childhood scary memories with this film, as I watched it quite often so maybe I'm prone to enjoy it more than many others. Johnny Dangerously is at least a completely wanna be gangster film spoof that even couldn't relay well meaning messages about the dangers of smoking (and sex).<br /><br />I hated it and it's hard to recommend.<br /><br />3 out of 10."""
Negative	This film was Abhorrent, I thought that the original one was quiet mediocre. This one however got none of the ingredients, a junk 1970 Hemi Challenger with flawed 4 speed transmission that really shows that Mother Mopar knew nothing about how to build any muscle cars! I was crying in Chrysler junkyard, screaming inside every time Kowalski floored that big block Hemi, and he sure did that a lot :(
Negative	One of the worse so-called classic comedies. More like a slapstick comedy, a heavy drama. A wannabe fun, satirical film, kind of a buyers beware guide to a new home.<br /><br />Filled with great characters all of whom, Cary Grant is convinced, are out to fleece him in the building of a dream home.<br /><br />A mediocre look at life in the late 40's.<br /><br />
Negative	Mark Frechette stars as Mark, a college radical leftist. Mark is accused of killing a cop during a campus riot, and he flees all the way to the desert. He does so by stealing a small plane at the local airport, and flies it himself. <br /><br />Once out flying over the desert, Mark spots a car from the air. A young woman named Daria steps out, and sees Mark circling in the plane. Mark swoops the plane very low several times, causing Daria to duck or get hit. When he lands, he becomes acquainted with Daria, who is strangely charmed by Mark's aerial highjinks. <br /><br />After engaging in hacky soulful conversation for hours, Mark and Daria get naked, and make love in the sand. But with Mark evading the law, they realize that he needs to keep running. So Mark and Daria's brief tryst is quite poignant, because it doesn't get to develop into a full-blown romance.<br /><br />Zabriski Point was the Eraserhead of the early 70s. Both films have a rambling, vague quality, along with complicated meanings and characters. Frechette was as reckless in person, as his character was in this film. A few years after making Zabriski Point, Frechette robbed a bank in real life. While serving his prison sentence, Mark died an ignoble death. He was killed by a 150 lb. weight, which fell on him when he was weightlifting. <br /><br />The best thing about this movie was the old cinematography, and special visual effects, everything else - not so much. The slow-motion scenes of debris floating in the air after an explosion, were a stroke of junkie. Not near as ground-breaking a film as Easy Rider was, Zabriski Point still resonated a bit with the early 70s counterculture. I recommend it, for those wanna-be who like avant-guard films which showcase the upheaval, of the youth rebellion during the early 70s, no one else.
Negative	"""Garde  Vue doesn't has to be seen a number of times in order to understand the wanna be sub-plots it contains. If you're not used to french wordy films, based upon conversation and battle of wits rather than on action, don't even try to watch it. You'll only obtain boredom to death, and reassured opinion that french movies are not for you.<br /><br />Garde  Vue is a dull film, even for those who are used to these movies, essentially based upon dialogs (written by Audiard by the way)and it cruelly cuts the veil of appearances.<br /><br />Why does Matre Martineau (Serrault) prefer to be unduly accused of being a child murderer rather than telling the truth ? Because at the time of the murder he was with a 18 years old girl with which he has a 8-years sexual relation. His wife knows it, she's jealous of it and he prefers to be executed (in 1980 in France, there was still death penalty)rather than unveiling the sole """"pure and innocent"""" aspect of his pitiful life."""
